stop abandoning/tk'ing you griefer ) :
[ time of eve ] ( http : //myanimelist.net/anime/7465/eve_no_jikan_movie ) has a very similar world and themes to ghost in the shell so you might like it . [ seirei no moribito ] ( http : //myanimelist.net/anime/1827/seirei_no_moribito ) is made by the same director as the ghost in the shell series and is a medieval fantasy just like berserk but not dark like berserk is. worth trying i think . if you just want a movie [ sword of the stranger ] ( http : //myanimelist.net/anime/2418/stranger__mukou_hadan ) is always good. basically a movie dedicated to showing off awesome sword fights and lots of blood .
