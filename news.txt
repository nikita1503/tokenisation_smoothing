cash is king in the world of corruption .

i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .
is n't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor 's office ? would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder .
if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pain
because that makes it okay... * smh *
ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance .
"the words "" anger "" and "" comcast "" come up often ."
reasonable safety concerns. the awareness that comes from these discussions trumps the the annual event .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
they should just switch providers if they are n't satisfied. ( see what i did there ? )
my bad people. i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource .
they are just misunderstood. they did this for free sex toys .
mmmmmm i need some of the bundy range fed beef. i hope the feds seize it all soon and put it up for sale .

"hope he gets the "" negros "" there to hear his theory or their culture and living style ."
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?

well then. that 's that .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
the difference ? money .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
obviously as white god intended .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .
where is the tipping point for police state ?

i do n't know how these people live with themselves .
i wonder how long it will be until they open another one .
sad that a majority of these are cancer related. hopefully karma will catch up to them .
i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

i would n't be mad if it was my wallet !

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?

how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs ?
...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?
so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .

so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .

i am confident that six months of probation she will receive will be difficult for her /s

"why does this headline say "" deadly rampage "" and not "" christian terrorism "" ?"
planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .

do n't know if anyone who got sick is interested in [ this ] ( http : //www.gelmans.com/readingroom/tabid/65/ctl/articleview/mid/372/articleid/526/burn-pits-claims.aspx ) but here ya go .

its really a shame that this is even nessesary
coulda gave that money to kanye
good god. /r/news commentary is really descending to the level of youtube comments . get a grip you sad sods .
may god bless him. he is a true patriot. spend the money for the future generation through the preservation of our national treasures .
how many hellfire missiles would that buy ?
its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring .
how dare that one-percenter not keep that money to themselves. it 's as if they are n't evil like sanders wants you to believe
i think it 's great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about. what i do n't like is that there should n't even be an issue with funding for our monuments .
if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .
how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions ?
it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .
those goddamn rich people are at it again ! dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges !
because republicans refuse to pay for it from fed budget ! !

can....can i help ?
ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
thank god i saved my hazardous exposure memos from balad and taji... if ne1 needs message privately

casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
than how will our government and cia function ?
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s

i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore .
oh they decided the law applies today ?

this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .

pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .

are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?

meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .

i love when people treat shit like this like news. downvote it to where it belongs .
i would trust this site over facebook .

this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

how enforceable is this really ? what do we do when we find tons of food that turns out to be from an illicit source ? destroy it ?

good luck is n't that the entire shrimp industry ?
why was n't this a law like 80 years ago ? ?
i live in a small fishing town and sometimes the price they get for their fish is equivalent to slave labor .
all goods from slave labor ?
can we ban retail items created by slave labor too ? looking at you nike .
it 's not a thing you ca n't import anything produced by slave labor ?

hell of a lot better plan than bombing the facilities in iran. good guy government ?
so they are calling it a success ?

y'alqueda finally facing justice !
from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?

hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents... per day .
here in the u.s. the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily . edit : some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously .
seriously why are we ( the u.s.a ) importing workers on visas to work at 7-11s ?
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .

they need stricter gun control .
not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships .


i got hit by a car in a parking lot once. i punched the car really hard just so the driver realized he was hitting me. it had nothing to do with challenging the driver to a fight or whatever .

free expression runs counter to the new religion of progressivism. the two simply are not compatible .

&gt ; man wanted for 66 sex offenses with child i hope that is n't a craigslist ad .

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .

no news here only small towns in the owens valley and it was n't even a moderate temblor .
who cares. oklahoma had a 5.1 the other day and it was n't even anything to write home about .
i moved away from california at the end of december. this helps reinforce my decision as a good idea .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
well... that just ruined my day

i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .

i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .
the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .

sad that a majority of these are cancer related. hopefully karma will catch up to them .

bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .

i thought this was child to child marriage. : / still fucked up but at least that 's not as bad as this.. .


sounds a lot like hi-tech money laundering to me

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .


the county commissioner who spearheaded the public sales tax for the bengals and reds stadia now works for the bengals .
let the $ 14 dollar beer flow .
corruption of public officials in michigan ? no way .
how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner 's hair ? ! ?
lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years. fuck off .
is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .
someone call charlie leduff !
i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news .
where is my surprise face ?
a city official operating at a congressional level .
you think that 's a wig ?
&gt ; detroit contractor who negotiated $ 285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so ? i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged .
i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him .
conflict of interests everywhere .
this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .
public money ? omg
what a shocking surprise !
well that 's convenient
can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign ?


i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .
is n't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor 's office ? would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder .
ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance .
if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pain
because that makes it okay... * smh *

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .


what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .



so an illegal escort vehicle gets pulled over and the entire funeral pulls over to raise hell .
good. the roads are for the living. have your moments at the funeral please .
got ta love reddits horrible bias with facts when it comes to the police .


good on his father for turning in his son for this crime. that cant be an easy thing to do. but he did the right thing .
that fucker is 19 ? looks 39
i hope the cop gets better .
dont ever let this shithead have an ounce of freedom
how does a bullet fragment if it enters through the eye ?
19 years old and your life 's over for the contents of a cash register. just.....why ?
wish people would stop shooting cops. it 's making them all scared and trigger happy .
kinda looks like trayvon martin and mike brown had a kid .
i do n't understand... reddit says that loggers and farmers have more dangerous jobs .
another prime blm example .
hope he gets a fair trial yo
how the hell do you survive a gunshot to the face ? that 's some 50 cent shit .
this thread https : //www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/460zpf/without_insulting_anyone_what_would_you_say_to/d01ln36
it 's about damn time we made sure innocent good people had guns and training and could defend themselves ! ! or.. we could stop giving guns to everybody. gee i do n't know. .
maybe the cop was making furtive movements .


14 billion years ? ? ? so what am i suppose to tell them when i get called in for a tax audit 15 billion years from now and my records only go back 14 billion years ?
i always love when brand new technologies claim forever .
wish someone would actually do this
they 'll be used as tiddly winks by some kids who dig them up billions of years from now .
quartz ? why do we have to code it onto quartz ? i 'm pretty sure i saw them somewhere record an mp3 file onto water .
when can i buy a burner ? i have to move onto my next project : archiving the world 's vast array of porn !

it says tourism is still banned. there are 12 categories of authorized travel but what are those categories ? cargo ? family ?
idk...looks like cuba has a future in manufacturing to me...just a hunch.. .
so there is no sex tourism like before the embargo yet ?
give the castros their money and let them build paper towns while the real population continues to suffer .
cuba is going on the vacation list. i bet there 's a ton of secluded beaches that have n't been trashed yet by countless tourists .

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle
i thought this was talking about jesse cox .
"yells loudly "" i will not ! "" . whispers "" if you need me too. """
i knew he was my favorite eagle
well that 's one bit of good news from cox. now if they 'd stop raising my rates every few months.. .
fuck yea cox ! ( comcast ) ^ -1 = cox
they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jones
almost every single person in my area that has gone to at&amp ; t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable . they have some shit with them but it 's far less shit than others .
the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .
cause they love internet freedom ? or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for .70 an hour ?
protected pirate plan from cox - $ 7500/month .

it 's an undesirable response to an undesirable reality that cop-killing is getting it 's own category as a hate crime .

as young as nine. nine years old. damn .
i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real. they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals .
i just wanted to point out the hand hover
i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .
eh. personally i 'm more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation. that 's the real problem .
the religion of peace...and pedophilia...and rape...and beheadings...and suicide bombings...and mass executions.. .
woody allen is dating again !

lol this is n't normal in lebanon and that is clear from the video. these people are actors

seriously why are we ( the u.s.a ) importing workers on visas to work at 7-11s ?

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .
"deadly rampage ? was "" terrorist attack "" a little too on-the-nose ?"

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .

i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .

idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope
driving drunk is not easy .

news update : spontaneous fires erupt in rome .
that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money .
probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .

i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .
another article with some details . http : //dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/
this is why i support gun ownership .
inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .
pieces of shit who 've done nothing but take from society
i hope that the assailants rot in prison .
i 'm sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case .
lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?
.... across the street from the fbi headquarters .
""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."
yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?
do black lives matter or do all lives matter ?
black lives matter ? to who ?


i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about !
anyone else get the feeling this was an ad ?
i bet tom from facebook is already a member
facebook 's shills are working overtime in this posts comments. i hope this social media site becomes a viable alternative .
private. social media. pick one .
i love when people treat shit like this like news. downvote it to where it belongs .
i would trust this site over facebook .

this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor. if and/or when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight .
i guess they could n't find a picture that makes him look crazier .
news update : spontaneous fires erupt in rome .
that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money .
probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .
looks as though he 's beginning a political career as a goldman / fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him. asshole .
godless commie socialism yes please
""" flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca n't fail "" did anyone else see this ! ? wtf ? so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further ?"
trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .
kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying... .

a special place in hell ... will probably begin in prison for this low-life .
if he is on film a trial should not be necessary. his public execution though. .
who wants to bet on whether he makes it through a trial ?
the death penalty needs to be expanded .

and darth vader &amp ; freddie kruger were left free ? where 's the justice ? !

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .

so long commandant lassard ! you brought me many laughs

how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs ?
...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?
so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .
aka manipulator in chief .
so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .
that seems like quite a comedown . with all due respect to this fine institution .
it 's about ethics in reddit

"hopefully the "" awareness-raising "" fraud that is the susan g. komen foundation for the cure ™ will soon follow ."
"not good enough. you do n't let con artists off the hook if they "" agree "" to shut down the scam. these people committed fraud and belong in jail ."
i do n't know how these people live with themselves .
i wonder how long it will be until they open another one .
sad that a majority of these are cancer related. hopefully karma will catch up to them .
i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

i 'm gon na take a stab in the dark and say its just the immense social pressure in the area to be successful but thats just me
the obvious solution to me is the banning or at least rerouting of all caltrains from this particular area .
what does disease control have to do with suicides ? why is this the cdc 's business ?
but if guns are involved they 'll be sued by the nra

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .

i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

hope he rots there for the rest of his miserable life !
he 's only 69 years old ? i had him pegged for going on 80 !

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .
who would let their son play american football ?

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?
but. . .but. . .how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca n't talk about dem big faces ?

fake it til you make it !

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
well... that just ruined my day
a man intentionally kills animals and gets 50 years in jail while a rich teenager gets probabtion for killing three people while driving drunk .
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

"yells loudly "" i will not ! "" . whispers "" if you need me too. """
i knew he was my favorite eagle
well that 's one bit of good news from cox. now if they 'd stop raising my rates every few months.. .
fuck yea cox ! ( comcast ) ^ -1 = cox
they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jones
the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .
cause they love internet freedom ? or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for .70 an hour ?

"" i want a 35 % raise or imma gon na rat you out "" .

i wonder how reddit is going to try to defend * this * pedophile .

anyone else get the feeling this was an ad ?

private. social media. pick one .
i love when people treat shit like this like news. downvote it to where it belongs .
i would trust this site over facebook .

well shit. i just read a til like last week about him still being alive .

i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .
is n't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor 's office ? would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder .

if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pain
because that makes it okay... * smh *

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !
pene means weiner in spanish. that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood .
maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year .

cash is king in the world of corruption .

...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .

that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .

there 's actually a legal question that you asked .

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .
who would let their son play american football ?

i hope he wears a big ass helmet all the time in order to avoid irony. them baseballs travel fast !

it 's almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt .
my college actually sodomizes me .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .

i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .

yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country .
and sanders wants to make this available for everyone. it 's not the money that causes this agency to be this way it 's the nature of the federal government .
can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional ? in short ? i do n't get it. it seems like they have tons of money but ca n't get their shit together .
tell me more about how universal healthcare will be awesome for the rest of us .
socialized healthcare no thanks .
government-run anything is a disaster .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .

well that 's one bit of good news from cox. now if they 'd stop raising my rates every few months.. .
fuck yea cox ! ( comcast ) ^ -1 = cox
they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jones

the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .
cause they love internet freedom ? or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for .70 an hour ?

how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .

"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !

then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?

i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .

this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .

it 's almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt .
my college actually sodomizes me .
maybe i should go to germany .
many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like. you have to be way more self organised and please do n't expect multiple choice tests .


this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .

can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .
let 's laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on non-essential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way... ( edit ; and get tax breaks from it too... )

how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions ?
it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .
those goddamn rich people are at it again ! dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges !

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0

that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .

well shit. i just read a til like last week about him still being alive .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
well... that just ruined my day
a man intentionally kills animals and gets 50 years in jail while a rich teenager gets probabtion for killing three people while driving drunk .
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .

now i 'm not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted ! i 'll just shoot all the moms and their doctors . absolute lunatic .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .

meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
well... that just ruined my day
a man intentionally kills animals and gets 50 years in jail while a rich teenager gets probabtion for killing three people while driving drunk .
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .

i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .

i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .

the majority of colorado is not going to be happy about this .
reasonable safety concerns. the awareness that comes from these discussions trumps the the annual event .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .

i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .

ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements

"* spits out drink * "" it 's fucking vodka man ! """


this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .
a tsgt i know died recently from cancer. he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family. he was 32. his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer .
""" support our troops with a ribbon sticker ! "" that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through ."
government does n't give a fuck about veterans .
do n't worry guys. we 'll take care of your medical needs when you come home. oh wait.... .
the us govt so cares about its troops.... .
i 've known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazard/disaster since chernobyl .
every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals... .
thank god i saved my hazardous exposure memos from balad and taji... if ne1 needs message privately
where is this going to lead to... ?
the horrors of our war in iraq seem to never end
"i read that as "" us military burns pit bulls "" ."
do n't know if anyone who got sick is interested in [ this ] ( http : //www.gelmans.com/readingroom/tabid/65/ctl/articleview/mid/372/articleid/526/burn-pits-claims.aspx ) but here ya go .
ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
well... that just ruined my day
a man intentionally kills animals and gets 50 years in jail while a rich teenager gets probabtion for killing three people while driving drunk .
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .


i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about !
anyone else get the feeling this was an ad ?
i bet tom from facebook is already a member
facebook 's shills are working overtime in this posts comments. i hope this social media site becomes a viable alternative .
private. social media. pick one .
i love when people treat shit like this like news. downvote it to where it belongs .
i would trust this site over facebook .

i 'm gon na take a stab in the dark and say its just the immense social pressure in the area to be successful but thats just me
the obvious solution to me is the banning or at least rerouting of all caltrains from this particular area .
what does disease control have to do with suicides ? why is this the cdc 's business ?
but if guns are involved they 'll be sued by the nra

&gt ; 90 percent of government revenues are from oil ; 70 percent of working saudis are employed by the government ; and even the private sector remains heavily dependent on government spending . haha that about sums up the structural problem right there !

sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11

this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .

how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions ?
it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .
those goddamn rich people are at it again ! dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges !

sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .

now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever .
this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever ; there 's no money to be made in curing a disease .

private. social media. pick one .
i love when people treat shit like this like news. downvote it to where it belongs .
i would trust this site over facebook .


i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
well... that just ruined my day
a man intentionally kills animals and gets 50 years in jail while a rich teenager gets probabtion for killing three people while driving drunk .
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .


i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?

""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."

i do n't know how these people live with themselves .
i wonder how long it will be until they open another one .
sad that a majority of these are cancer related. hopefully karma will catch up to them .
i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .

i 'm in fresno &amp ; i felt it . .
california laughs at your pitiful magnitude 5 earthquakes .
we call that 'tuesday'
no news here only small towns in the owens valley and it was n't even a moderate temblor .
who cares. oklahoma had a 5.1 the other day and it was n't even anything to write home about .
i moved away from california at the end of december. this helps reinforce my decision as a good idea .

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .

ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .


fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .

i guess they could n't find a picture that makes him look crazier .
news update : spontaneous fires erupt in rome .
that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money .
probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .
looks as though he 's beginning a political career as a goldman / fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him. asshole .
godless commie socialism yes please
""" flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca n't fail "" did anyone else see this ! ? wtf ? so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further ?"
trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .
kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying... .

i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .
is n't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor 's office ? would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder .
ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance .
if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pain

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .

i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !
pene means weiner in spanish. that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood .

is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .
someone call charlie leduff !
i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news .
where is my surprise face ?
a city official operating at a congressional level .
you think that 's a wig ?
&gt ; detroit contractor who negotiated $ 285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so ? i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged .
i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him .
conflict of interests everywhere .
this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .
public money ? omg
what a shocking surprise !
well that 's convenient
can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign ?

okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .
who the fuck are they to demand this ? are white/asian/latino people not allowed to be affected by this ?


they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope

i 'm in fresno &amp ; i felt it . .
california laughs at your pitiful magnitude 5 earthquakes .
we call that 'tuesday'
no news here only small towns in the owens valley and it was n't even a moderate temblor .
who cares. oklahoma had a 5.1 the other day and it was n't even anything to write home about .
i moved away from california at the end of december. this helps reinforce my decision as a good idea .

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .


because america loves her servicemen and women so she wants them to help themselves

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .

then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s

politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .

maybe i should go to germany .
many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like. you have to be way more self organised and please do n't expect multiple choice tests .


i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .
pieces of shit who 've done nothing but take from society
i hope that the assailants rot in prison .
i 'm sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case .
lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?
.... across the street from the fbi headquarters .
""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."
yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?
do black lives matter or do all lives matter ?
black lives matter ? to who ?

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !
pene means weiner in spanish. that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood .

how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs ?
...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success

i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !

are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?

sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
well... that just ruined my day
a man intentionally kills animals and gets 50 years in jail while a rich teenager gets probabtion for killing three people while driving drunk .
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."

"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !

12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope
driving drunk is not easy .
what is 10 day weekend work release ?
that 's cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work release

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

i guess they could n't find a picture that makes him look crazier .
news update : spontaneous fires erupt in rome .
that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money .
probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .
looks as though he 's beginning a political career as a goldman / fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him. asshole .

ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .



also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .

the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?
offitherrrr i am the law

her judgement was impaired

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?

cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .

pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .

no they 'll stop or pack up and leave . ahhh....incentives .
because d'ontravious demands fresh cilantro .
i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved ?

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
well... that just ruined my day
a man intentionally kills animals and gets 50 years in jail while a rich teenager gets probabtion for killing three people while driving drunk .
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .


what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11

not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0
so are these bison the ones from the original wild flock that were decimated to almost zero ? i heard there is two breeds the original and a commercial domesticated one ?

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .
where is the tipping point for police state ?
the stingray is just one of [ many ] ( https : //theintercept.com/surveillance-catalogue/ ) devices used by our governmental police agencies against us .
what is the point of all this secrecy ? this stuff always comes out .

i just hope they can one by one get every one of those asshole cowboy action-figure wannabes that showed up with their guns to display their extreme patriotism through their act of sedition .

ah the browndogle wasting tax payers money for years to come .

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .


at least the guy was honest .
i would n't be mad if it was my wallet !
how do they know the guy was homeless ?

good on his father for turning in his son for this crime. that cant be an easy thing to do. but he did the right thing .
that fucker is 19 ? looks 39
i hope the cop gets better .
dont ever let this shithead have an ounce of freedom
how does a bullet fragment if it enters through the eye ?
19 years old and your life 's over for the contents of a cash register. just.....why ?
wish people would stop shooting cops. it 's making them all scared and trigger happy .

maybe the cop was making furtive movements .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

well who 's gon na judge the case now ?
her judgement was impaired
fry needs to weigh in here : http : //imgur.com/gvji0um
ny state troopers only care about the star program. more tix/arrest = promotion/money. so if they could get points on there own mother they would .
i 'm just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit xd
i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .

how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .

just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?

do n't know if anyone who got sick is interested in [ this ] ( http : //www.gelmans.com/readingroom/tabid/65/ctl/articleview/mid/372/articleid/526/burn-pits-claims.aspx ) but here ya go .
ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

14 billion years ? ? ? so what am i suppose to tell them when i get called in for a tax audit 15 billion years from now and my records only go back 14 billion years ?
i always love when brand new technologies claim forever .
wish someone would actually do this
they 'll be used as tiddly winks by some kids who dig them up billions of years from now .
quartz ? why do we have to code it onto quartz ? i 'm pretty sure i saw them somewhere record an mp3 file onto water .
when can i buy a burner ? i have to move onto my next project : archiving the world 's vast array of porn !

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .


i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
well... that just ruined my day
a man intentionally kills animals and gets 50 years in jail while a rich teenager gets probabtion for killing three people while driving drunk .
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope
driving drunk is not easy .
what is 10 day weekend work release ?
that 's cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work release
and my mom wonders why i 'm not married .

this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor. if and/or when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight .
i guess they could n't find a picture that makes him look crazier .
news update : spontaneous fires erupt in rome .
that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money .
probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .
looks as though he 's beginning a political career as a goldman / fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him. asshole .
godless commie socialism yes please
""" flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca n't fail "" did anyone else see this ! ? wtf ? so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further ?"
trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .

&gt ; the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault . there 's your problem right there. how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such .
seems like the girl was so hammered that she could n't remember the sex. figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault .


and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

cash is king in the world of corruption .

it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0
so are these bison the ones from the original wild flock that were decimated to almost zero ? i heard there is two breeds the original and a commercial domesticated one ?

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?

if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .
can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .
let 's laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on non-essential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way... ( edit ; and get tax breaks from it too... )
we are living in a new gilded age .
how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions ?
it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .
those goddamn rich people are at it again ! dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges !
fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy .
because republicans refuse to pay for it from fed budget ! !

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .

so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
well... that just ruined my day
a man intentionally kills animals and gets 50 years in jail while a rich teenager gets probabtion for killing three people while driving drunk .
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .


it 's almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
well... that just ruined my day
a man intentionally kills animals and gets 50 years in jail while a rich teenager gets probabtion for killing three people while driving drunk .
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .

cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."

there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .


* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .

i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .

it still taste oh so goooooooood !

idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .

i 've known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazard/disaster since chernobyl .
thank god i saved my hazardous exposure memos from balad and taji... if ne1 needs message privately
where is this going to lead to... ?
the horrors of our war in iraq seem to never end
"i read that as "" us military burns pit bulls "" ."
do n't know if anyone who got sick is interested in [ this ] ( http : //www.gelmans.com/readingroom/tabid/65/ctl/articleview/mid/372/articleid/526/burn-pits-claims.aspx ) but here ya go .
ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

charley bartlet ?

i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .
the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?
offitherrrr i am the law
rochesterian here. the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long .
i drove through rochester today ! has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate ?
new york has pretty harsh dui laws if my memory serves me correctly
[ it 's fucking vodka maaaaaaaaaan ! ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = r5h6ie_hd_g )
that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women .
if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful positions
well who 's gon na judge the case now ?
her judgement was impaired
fry needs to weigh in here : http : //imgur.com/gvji0um
ny state troopers only care about the star program. more tix/arrest = promotion/money. so if they could get points on there own mother they would .
i 'm just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit xd
i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore .
oh they decided the law applies today ?
"* spits out drink * "" it 's fucking vodka man ! """


this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor. if and/or when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight .
i guess they could n't find a picture that makes him look crazier .
news update : spontaneous fires erupt in rome .
that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money .
probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .
looks as though he 's beginning a political career as a goldman / fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him. asshole .
godless commie socialism yes please
""" flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca n't fail "" did anyone else see this ! ? wtf ? so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further ?"
trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .
kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying... .

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .
who would let their son play american football ?

i hope he wears a big ass helmet all the time in order to avoid irony. them baseballs travel fast !

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .


someone should tell this kid that he can see pussy on the internet for free. a for effort though .

i do n't know how these people live with themselves .
i wonder how long it will be until they open another one .
sad that a majority of these are cancer related. hopefully karma will catch up to them .
i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

"never thought i would read the phrase * lab grown vaginas "" . but here we are ."

i 'm 100 % fine with this. i ca n't believe they need apple though. unless they want everything done legally .

while the koches paid the mob in nevada to outlaw anything similar there. or so i hypothesize .


fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .

ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?

its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .

how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .

not true from my experience .
"why does this headline say "" deadly rampage "" and not "" christian terrorism "" ?"

i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .

i love when people treat shit like this like news. downvote it to where it belongs .
i would trust this site over facebook .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .

tom bombadil is weird as all hell .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .

so more than two months later and they are still farting around getting information that could be important in preventing future actions ? wtf ?
eh. personally i 'm more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation. that 's the real problem .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .

no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !

casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .

well then. that 's that .

i think it 's great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about. what i do n't like is that there should n't even be an issue with funding for our monuments .

well shit. i just read a til like last week about him still being alive .
his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek .
it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .

how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs ?
...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?
so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .
aka manipulator in chief .
so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .
that seems like quite a comedown . with all due respect to this fine institution .
it 's about ethics in reddit

cash is king in the world of corruption .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .

is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .

i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him .
conflict of interests everywhere .
this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .

does n't this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food ?
""" 7/11 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets """
what if the healthy foods do n't sell ? are they still forced to stock them ? would n't you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government ?
no they 'll stop or pack up and leave . ahhh....incentives .

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

how enforceable is this really ? what do we do when we find tons of food that turns out to be from an illicit source ? destroy it ?
i had no idea this was even a thing
good luck is n't that the entire shrimp industry ?
why was n't this a law like 80 years ago ? ?
i live in a small fishing town and sometimes the price they get for their fish is equivalent to slave labor .
all goods from slave labor ?
can we ban retail items created by slave labor too ? looking at you nike .
it 's not a thing you ca n't import anything produced by slave labor ?

i 'm gon na take a stab in the dark and say its just the immense social pressure in the area to be successful but thats just me
the obvious solution to me is the banning or at least rerouting of all caltrains from this particular area .
what does disease control have to do with suicides ? why is this the cdc 's business ?

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .

i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .

damned if you do damned if you dont .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
fuck. people are fucked .

the real lesson here is do n't trust anyone. i certainly do n't anymore .
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (

can you tell florida house that please ? ?

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?

jesus the auto repairman ?

a special place in hell ... will probably begin in prison for this low-life .
if he is on film a trial should not be necessary. his public execution though. .
who wants to bet on whether he makes it through a trial ?
the death penalty needs to be expanded .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?

what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .

how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

the stingray is just one of [ many ] ( https : //theintercept.com/surveillance-catalogue/ ) devices used by our governmental police agencies against us .
what is the point of all this secrecy ? this stuff always comes out .

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

they need stricter gun control .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riots
my bad people. i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource .
&gt ; across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast * in my town alone * .
i like how this is news in this country .
comcast angers me even without outages .
"the words "" anger "" and "" comcast "" come up often ."
is anyone else still completely fucking down ? just everything ? been down for 15 hours here .
i 've had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i 've never had an issue .
that 's what happens. things go out sometimes .
it 's nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks .
""" compact angers thousands across the u.s. for something other than just being comcast for once "" ftfy"
they just put a data cap on my home internet. how fucked is that ? pretty fucked if you ask me .

i got hit by a car in a parking lot once. i punched the car really hard just so the driver realized he was hitting me. it had nothing to do with challenging the driver to a fight or whatever .

his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek .

as young as nine. nine years old. damn .
i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real. they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals .
i just wanted to point out the hand hover
i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .
eh. personally i 'm more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation. that 's the real problem .

someone post this on r/feminism and see where that fuse leads too. i would but i been banned for positing stuff that does n't fit the narrative
i thought this was child to child marriage. : / still fucked up but at least that 's not as bad as this.. .


fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .
"deadly rampage ? was "" terrorist attack "" a little too on-the-nose ?"
"why does this headline say "" deadly rampage "" and not "" christian terrorism "" ?"

idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope
driving drunk is not easy .
what is 10 day weekend work release ?
that 's cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work release

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."
yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

""" men who might be in their 30 's "" . real helpful description ."
i got hit by a car in a parking lot once. i punched the car really hard just so the driver realized he was hitting me. it had nothing to do with challenging the driver to a fight or whatever .

fake it til you make it !

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .

just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s

where i live i would love to have this problem


i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .

jesus the auto repairman ?

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .
another article with some details . http : //dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/
this is why i support gun ownership .
inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .
pieces of shit who 've done nothing but take from society
i hope that the assailants rot in prison .
i 'm sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case .
lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?
.... across the street from the fbi headquarters .
""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."
yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?
do black lives matter or do all lives matter ?
black lives matter ? to who ?


they need stricter gun control .

hell of a lot better plan than bombing the facilities in iran. good guy government ?
so they are calling it a success ?
if only they used that cyber attack on shitbag israel instead. la-hymen !

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?
but. . .but. . .how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca n't talk about dem big faces ?

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle
i thought this was talking about jesse cox .
"yells loudly "" i will not ! "" . whispers "" if you need me too. """
i knew he was my favorite eagle
well that 's one bit of good news from cox. now if they 'd stop raising my rates every few months.. .
fuck yea cox ! ( comcast ) ^ -1 = cox
they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jones
almost every single person in my area that has gone to at&amp ; t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable . they have some shit with them but it 's far less shit than others .
the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .
cause they love internet freedom ? or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for .70 an hour ?
protected pirate plan from cox - $ 7500/month .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .

so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .

it still taste oh so goooooooood !

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?

where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?
so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .

so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .

i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .

&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .

so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !
pene means weiner in spanish. that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood .

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .
a tsgt i know died recently from cancer. he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family. he was 32. his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer .
""" support our troops with a ribbon sticker ! "" that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through ."
government does n't give a fuck about veterans .
do n't worry guys. we 'll take care of your medical needs when you come home. oh wait.... .
the us govt so cares about its troops.... .
i 've known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazard/disaster since chernobyl .
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals... .
thank god i saved my hazardous exposure memos from balad and taji... if ne1 needs message privately
where is this going to lead to... ?
the horrors of our war in iraq seem to never end
"i read that as "" us military burns pit bulls "" ."
do n't know if anyone who got sick is interested in [ this ] ( http : //www.gelmans.com/readingroom/tabid/65/ctl/articleview/mid/372/articleid/526/burn-pits-claims.aspx ) but here ya go .
ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .

is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .
you think that 's a wig ?
someone call charlie leduff !
i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news .
where is my surprise face ?
a city official operating at a congressional level .
&gt ; detroit contractor who negotiated $ 285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so ? i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged .
i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him .
conflict of interests everywhere .
this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .
public money ? omg
what a shocking surprise !
well that 's convenient
can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign ?


i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

i think it 's great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about. what i do n't like is that there should n't even be an issue with funding for our monuments .
if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .
can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .

it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .

fake it til you make it !

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .

not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle
i thought this was talking about jesse cox .

they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jones
almost every single person in my area that has gone to at&amp ; t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable . they have some shit with them but it 's far less shit than others .
the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .
cause they love internet freedom ? or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for .70 an hour ?

14 billion years ? ? ? so what am i suppose to tell them when i get called in for a tax audit 15 billion years from now and my records only go back 14 billion years ?
i always love when brand new technologies claim forever .
wish someone would actually do this
they 'll be used as tiddly winks by some kids who dig them up billions of years from now .
quartz ? why do we have to code it onto quartz ? i 'm pretty sure i saw them somewhere record an mp3 file onto water .
when can i buy a burner ? i have to move onto my next project : archiving the world 's vast array of porn !

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .


this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor. if and/or when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight .
i guess they could n't find a picture that makes him look crazier .
news update : spontaneous fires erupt in rome .
that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money .
probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .
looks as though he 's beginning a political career as a goldman / fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him. asshole .

&gt ; the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault . there 's your problem right there. how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such .

seems like the girl was so hammered that she could n't remember the sex. figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault .

pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long run
and sanders wants to make this available for everyone. it 's not the money that causes this agency to be this way it 's the nature of the federal government .
can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional ? in short ? i do n't get it. it seems like they have tons of money but ca n't get their shit together .

can anyone say hillbilly ?

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?
but. . .but. . .how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca n't talk about dem big faces ?

free expression runs counter to the new religion of progressivism. the two simply are not compatible .

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .

cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?

sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .

someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .

so long commandant lassard ! you brought me many laughs

i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .
the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?
offitherrrr i am the law
rochesterian here. the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long .
i drove through rochester today ! has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate ?
new york has pretty harsh dui laws if my memory serves me correctly
[ it 's fucking vodka maaaaaaaaaan ! ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = r5h6ie_hd_g )
that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women .
if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful positions
well who 's gon na judge the case now ?
her judgement was impaired
fry needs to weigh in here : http : //imgur.com/gvji0um
ny state troopers only care about the star program. more tix/arrest = promotion/money. so if they could get points on there own mother they would .
i 'm just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit xd
i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore .
oh they decided the law applies today ?

why is this front page


i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

they need stricter gun control .

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .

this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope
driving drunk is not easy .
what is 10 day weekend work release ?
that 's cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work release

i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .
where is the tipping point for police state ?
the stingray is just one of [ many ] ( https : //theintercept.com/surveillance-catalogue/ ) devices used by our governmental police agencies against us .
what is the point of all this secrecy ? this stuff always comes out .

jesus the auto repairman ?

well shit. i just read a til like last week about him still being alive .
his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever .
this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever ; there 's no money to be made in curing a disease .

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .

ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?

such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

anyone else surprised at the extremely low interest rates for mexican bonds ? i would of thought that their borrowing costs was more in line with other developing countries .

where i live i would love to have this problem


also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?

okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .

i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .

seriously why are we ( the u.s.a ) importing workers on visas to work at 7-11s ?

i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about !
anyone else get the feeling this was an ad ?

private. social media. pick one .
i love when people treat shit like this like news. downvote it to where it belongs .
i would trust this site over facebook .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .

how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .

"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."

i ca n't even imagine how messed up in the brain you have to be to do something like this. i hope the boy can get past this and recover. thoughts and prayers to him and his family : ( stay strong buddy .
i am confident that six months of probation she will receive will be difficult for her /s
"i ca n't fucking believe the people posting here defending this woman... in a reversed situation there 'd just be people calling for his head and wishing he get killed in prison. instead we 're treated to people trying to find some way to defend or deflect the situation ? wtf a boy gets raped and people think what ? "" hurr well maybe he did it ? """
sentenced to 20 dollar fine .
if she only waited five more years in some states they would sentence that 12 year old to child support payments .
holy shit the comment section here.. .
wooooooooo south dakota made the front page ! fuck ! for awful reasons again !
but women cant rape men .
women dont go to jail as much as men for the same crime. it 's disgusting
itt : people who do n't understand statistics or sarcasm .
not one comment about how she should be killed or have a train run on her in prison... double standards so glaring it 's like staring at the sun
if she had gotten pregnant would she have been able to sue for child support ?
[ i present the culprit ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = hgj-dxskiqa )
judge is going to come down on her hard with 6 months probation i guarantee .
let 's see what she looks like
i hope he siouxs her ass off !
"andddddd i doubt she "" ll get hardly any time or punishment"
why is this front page

hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents... per day .
not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships .
here in the u.s. the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily . edit : some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously .
seriously why are we ( the u.s.a ) importing workers on visas to work at 7-11s ?

...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?
so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .
aka manipulator in chief .
so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .
that seems like quite a comedown . with all due respect to this fine institution .
it 's about ethics in reddit

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .


this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .


the county commissioner who spearheaded the public sales tax for the bengals and reds stadia now works for the bengals .
let the $ 14 dollar beer flow .
corruption of public officials in michigan ? no way .
how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner 's hair ? ! ?
lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years. fuck off .
is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .
you think that 's a wig ?
someone call charlie leduff !
i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news .
where is my surprise face ?
a city official operating at a congressional level .
&gt ; detroit contractor who negotiated $ 285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so ? i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged .
i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him .
conflict of interests everywhere .
this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .
public money ? omg
what a shocking surprise !
well that 's convenient
can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign ?

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .
aka manipulator in chief .
so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .
that seems like quite a comedown . with all due respect to this fine institution .
it 's about ethics in reddit

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?
but. . .but. . .how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca n't talk about dem big faces ?

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .

&gt ; the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault . there 's your problem right there. how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such .
damned if you do damned if you dont .
seems like the girl was so hammered that she could n't remember the sex. figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault .


i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .
the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?

well who 's gon na judge the case now ?
her judgement was impaired

this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !

are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?

sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .

bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .

its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .
who would let their son play american football ?

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .

&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .


i wonder how reddit is going to try to defend * this * pedophile .

yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country .
that vm box is gon na get overloaded quick
pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long run

can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional ? in short ? i do n't get it. it seems like they have tons of money but ca n't get their shit together .
tell me more about how universal healthcare will be awesome for the rest of us .
socialized healthcare no thanks .
government-run anything is a disaster .

i 'm gon na take a stab in the dark and say its just the immense social pressure in the area to be successful but thats just me

can someone eli5 me why we even need fracked oil right now when prices are projected to keep dropping ?

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .

now there is a precedence.... i hope apple can appeal this ? ! ? ! ?
i 'm 100 % fine with this. i ca n't believe they need apple though. unless they want everything done legally .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like. you have to be way more self organised and please do n't expect multiple choice tests .


i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .
another article with some details . http : //dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/
this is why i support gun ownership .
inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .
pieces of shit who 've done nothing but take from society
i hope that the assailants rot in prison .
i 'm sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case .
lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?
.... across the street from the fbi headquarters .
""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."
yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?
do black lives matter or do all lives matter ?
black lives matter ? to who ?


idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope
driving drunk is not easy .
what is 10 day weekend work release ?
that 's cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work release

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !

so more than two months later and they are still farting around getting information that could be important in preventing future actions ? wtf ?

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?

not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .
where is the tipping point for police state ?

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

how many hellfire missiles would that buy ?
its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring .
how dare that one-percenter not keep that money to themselves. it 's as if they are n't evil like sanders wants you to believe
i think it 's great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about. what i do n't like is that there should n't even be an issue with funding for our monuments .
if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .
can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .
let 's laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on non-essential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way... ( edit ; and get tax breaks from it too... )

it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .

i 've known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazard/disaster since chernobyl .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

so more than two months later and they are still farting around getting information that could be important in preventing future actions ? wtf ?

it says tourism is still banned. there are 12 categories of authorized travel but what are those categories ? cargo ? family ?
idk...looks like cuba has a future in manufacturing to me...just a hunch.. .
so there is no sex tourism like before the embargo yet ?
give the castros their money and let them build paper towns while the real population continues to suffer .
cuba is going on the vacation list. i bet there 's a ton of secluded beaches that have n't been trashed yet by countless tourists .

so an illegal escort vehicle gets pulled over and the entire funeral pulls over to raise hell .

14 billion years ? ? ? so what am i suppose to tell them when i get called in for a tax audit 15 billion years from now and my records only go back 14 billion years ?
i always love when brand new technologies claim forever .
wish someone would actually do this
they 'll be used as tiddly winks by some kids who dig them up billions of years from now .
quartz ? why do we have to code it onto quartz ? i 'm pretty sure i saw them somewhere record an mp3 file onto water .
when can i buy a burner ? i have to move onto my next project : archiving the world 's vast array of porn !

so parmesan might be vegan .
i 've always said my spaghetti lacks a certain wood pulpiness .
they use wood pulp for all sorts of shit ! years back i learned that orange juice pulp was actually tree pulp ! fuck that... i never drank orange juice with pulp ever again ! !

i do n't know how these people live with themselves .
i wonder how long it will be until they open another one .
sad that a majority of these are cancer related. hopefully karma will catch up to them .
i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever .

it 's an undesirable response to an undesirable reality that cop-killing is getting it 's own category as a hate crime .

i do believe they are n't understanding that the phone ca n't be decrypted by apple or anyone .
why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there ? learn2nsa fbi
this is what the fbi was looking for : the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone 's phone. at any time .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .
is n't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor 's office ? would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder .
ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance .
if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pain
because that makes it okay... * smh *

because america loves her servicemen and women so she wants them to help themselves
i have been calling the helpline everyday for 2 weeks. it is a recorded message saying call back later we are busy. just then general va helpline .
yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country .
that vm box is gon na get overloaded quick
pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long run
and sanders wants to make this available for everyone. it 's not the money that causes this agency to be this way it 's the nature of the federal government .
can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional ? in short ? i do n't get it. it seems like they have tons of money but ca n't get their shit together .
tell me more about how universal healthcare will be awesome for the rest of us .

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .
"deadly rampage ? was "" terrorist attack "" a little too on-the-nose ?"
"why does this headline say "" deadly rampage "" and not "" christian terrorism "" ?"
now i 'm not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted ! i 'll just shoot all the moms and their doctors . absolute lunatic .
thank god its back open. now we can get back to crushing fetus ' heads and sucking their brains out like normal people .
on president 's day ? ! the gaul !
pp is where there is regular deadly rampages..... against unborn babies... .
planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing .

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle
i thought this was talking about jesse cox .

they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jones
almost every single person in my area that has gone to at&amp ; t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable . they have some shit with them but it 's far less shit than others .
the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .

i 've known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazard/disaster since chernobyl .

every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals... .

my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?


while the koches paid the mob in nevada to outlaw anything similar there. or so i hypothesize .

its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .

someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

thats bad news for all the 7-11 in our town that take them
does n't this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food ?
""" 7/11 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets """
what if the healthy foods do n't sell ? are they still forced to stock them ? would n't you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government ?
no they 'll stop or pack up and leave . ahhh....incentives .

i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved ?

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?

this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !

its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11

so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .

how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !

just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s

is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .

cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

i 'm going to assume that the project is getting a lot of input from people who were ignored for the last couple years and/or late additions from people who just walked in the door . typical design by committee bullshit that happens
put the team behind the bay bridge project in charge. it will become a guaranteed success . ( hopefully the /s wo n't be necessary... )
ah the browndogle wasting tax payers money for years to come .
no keep turning the earths crust into swiss cheese for profit i 'm sure everything will be fine .
can someone eli5 me why we even need fracked oil right now when prices are projected to keep dropping ?

why did n't they care this much about their freaking * home * ? remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting. it was live on cnn ffs !
i do believe they are n't understanding that the phone ca n't be decrypted by apple or anyone .
this is what the fbi was looking for : the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone 's phone. at any time .
why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there ? learn2nsa fbi

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .


also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?
but. . .but. . .how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca n't talk about dem big faces ?

i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .

thats bad news for all the 7-11 in our town that take them
does n't this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food ?
""" 7/11 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets """
what if the healthy foods do n't sell ? are they still forced to stock them ? would n't you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government ?
no they 'll stop or pack up and leave . ahhh....incentives .
because d'ontravious demands fresh cilantro .
i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved ?

its really a shame that this is even nessesary
coulda gave that money to kanye
these responses... wow .
good god. /r/news commentary is really descending to the level of youtube comments . get a grip you sad sods .
may god bless him. he is a true patriot. spend the money for the future generation through the preservation of our national treasures .
how many hellfire missiles would that buy ?
its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring .
how dare that one-percenter not keep that money to themselves. it 's as if they are n't evil like sanders wants you to believe
i think it 's great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about. what i do n't like is that there should n't even be an issue with funding for our monuments .
if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .
can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .
let 's laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on non-essential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way... ( edit ; and get tax breaks from it too... )
we are living in a new gilded age .
how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions ?
it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .
those goddamn rich people are at it again ! dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges !
fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy .
because republicans refuse to pay for it from fed budget ! !

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !
pene means weiner in spanish. that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood .
maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year .
just buy the block/wedge and grate your own .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .
where is the tipping point for police state ?
the stingray is just one of [ many ] ( https : //theintercept.com/surveillance-catalogue/ ) devices used by our governmental police agencies against us .

how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner 's hair ? ! ?
lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years. fuck off .
is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .
you think that 's a wig ?
someone call charlie leduff !
i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news .
where is my surprise face ?
a city official operating at a congressional level .
&gt ; detroit contractor who negotiated $ 285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so ? i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged .
i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him .
conflict of interests everywhere .
this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .
public money ? omg
what a shocking surprise !
well that 's convenient

it 's almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt .
my college actually sodomizes me .
maybe i should go to germany .
many american students also come with very false expectations about what german university is like. you have to be way more self organised and please do n't expect multiple choice tests .


anyone else surprised at the extremely low interest rates for mexican bonds ? i would of thought that their borrowing costs was more in line with other developing countries .

idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope
driving drunk is not easy .
what is 10 day weekend work release ?
that 's cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work release
and my mom wonders why i 'm not married .


do n't witch hunt. this woman deserves a fair trial. you ca n't always believe the stuff that comes out of a child .
i ca n't even imagine how messed up in the brain you have to be to do something like this. i hope the boy can get past this and recover. thoughts and prayers to him and his family : ( stay strong buddy .
i am confident that six months of probation she will receive will be difficult for her /s
"i ca n't fucking believe the people posting here defending this woman... in a reversed situation there 'd just be people calling for his head and wishing he get killed in prison. instead we 're treated to people trying to find some way to defend or deflect the situation ? wtf a boy gets raped and people think what ? "" hurr well maybe he did it ? """
sentenced to 20 dollar fine .
if she only waited five more years in some states they would sentence that 12 year old to child support payments .
holy shit the comment section here.. .
wooooooooo south dakota made the front page ! fuck ! for awful reasons again !
but women cant rape men .
women dont go to jail as much as men for the same crime. it 's disgusting
itt : people who do n't understand statistics or sarcasm .
not one comment about how she should be killed or have a train run on her in prison... double standards so glaring it 's like staring at the sun
if she had gotten pregnant would she have been able to sue for child support ?
[ i present the culprit ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = hgj-dxskiqa )
judge is going to come down on her hard with 6 months probation i guarantee .
let 's see what she looks like
i hope he siouxs her ass off !
"andddddd i doubt she "" ll get hardly any time or punishment"
why is this front page


fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .
"deadly rampage ? was "" terrorist attack "" a little too on-the-nose ?"
"why does this headline say "" deadly rampage "" and not "" christian terrorism "" ?"
now i 'm not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted ! i 'll just shoot all the moms and their doctors . absolute lunatic .
thank god its back open. now we can get back to crushing fetus ' heads and sucking their brains out like normal people .
on president 's day ? ! the gaul !
pp is where there is regular deadly rampages..... against unborn babies... .
planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing .

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .
another article with some details . http : //dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/
this is why i support gun ownership .
inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .
pieces of shit who 've done nothing but take from society
i hope that the assailants rot in prison .
i 'm sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case .
lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?
.... across the street from the fbi headquarters .
""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."
yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?
do black lives matter or do all lives matter ?
black lives matter ? to who ?


how enforceable is this really ? what do we do when we find tons of food that turns out to be from an illicit source ? destroy it ?
i had no idea this was even a thing
good luck is n't that the entire shrimp industry ?
why was n't this a law like 80 years ago ? ?
i live in a small fishing town and sometimes the price they get for their fish is equivalent to slave labor .
all goods from slave labor ?
can we ban retail items created by slave labor too ? looking at you nike .
it 's not a thing you ca n't import anything produced by slave labor ?

i hope they left quietly after looking in the window . they might enjoy this over at r/walkingdead

i ca n't even imagine how messed up in the brain you have to be to do something like this. i hope the boy can get past this and recover. thoughts and prayers to him and his family : ( stay strong buddy .
i am confident that six months of probation she will receive will be difficult for her /s
"i ca n't fucking believe the people posting here defending this woman... in a reversed situation there 'd just be people calling for his head and wishing he get killed in prison. instead we 're treated to people trying to find some way to defend or deflect the situation ? wtf a boy gets raped and people think what ? "" hurr well maybe he did it ? """
sentenced to 20 dollar fine .
if she only waited five more years in some states they would sentence that 12 year old to child support payments .
holy shit the comment section here.. .
wooooooooo south dakota made the front page ! fuck ! for awful reasons again !
but women cant rape men .
women dont go to jail as much as men for the same crime. it 's disgusting
itt : people who do n't understand statistics or sarcasm .
not one comment about how she should be killed or have a train run on her in prison... double standards so glaring it 's like staring at the sun
if she had gotten pregnant would she have been able to sue for child support ?
[ i present the culprit ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = hgj-dxskiqa )
judge is going to come down on her hard with 6 months probation i guarantee .
let 's see what she looks like
i hope he siouxs her ass off !
"andddddd i doubt she "" ll get hardly any time or punishment"
why is this front page


&gt ; police told local media they still don ’ t have a motive . assisted suicide would be my bet

i 'm gon na take a stab in the dark and say its just the immense social pressure in the area to be successful but thats just me
the obvious solution to me is the banning or at least rerouting of all caltrains from this particular area .
what does disease control have to do with suicides ? why is this the cdc 's business ?
but if guns are involved they 'll be sued by the nra

i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .
the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?
offitherrrr i am the law
rochesterian here. the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long .
i drove through rochester today ! has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate ?
new york has pretty harsh dui laws if my memory serves me correctly
[ it 's fucking vodka maaaaaaaaaan ! ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = r5h6ie_hd_g )
that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women .
if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful positions
well who 's gon na judge the case now ?
her judgement was impaired
fry needs to weigh in here : http : //imgur.com/gvji0um
ny state troopers only care about the star program. more tix/arrest = promotion/money. so if they could get points on there own mother they would .
i 'm just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit xd
i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore .
oh they decided the law applies today ?
"* spits out drink * "" it 's fucking vodka man ! """


so more than two months later and they are still farting around getting information that could be important in preventing future actions ? wtf ?

corruption of public officials in michigan ? no way .
how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner 's hair ? ! ?
lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years. fuck off .
is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .
you think that 's a wig ?
someone call charlie leduff !
i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news .
where is my surprise face ?
a city official operating at a congressional level .
&gt ; detroit contractor who negotiated $ 285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so ? i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged .
i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him .
conflict of interests everywhere .
this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .
public money ? omg
what a shocking surprise !
well that 's convenient
can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign ?


14 billion years ? ? ? so what am i suppose to tell them when i get called in for a tax audit 15 billion years from now and my records only go back 14 billion years ?

they 'll be used as tiddly winks by some kids who dig them up billions of years from now .

how does a bullet fragment if it enters through the eye ?
19 years old and your life 's over for the contents of a cash register. just.....why ?
wish people would stop shooting cops. it 's making them all scared and trigger happy .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .

do n't know if anyone who got sick is interested in [ this ] ( http : //www.gelmans.com/readingroom/tabid/65/ctl/articleview/mid/372/articleid/526/burn-pits-claims.aspx ) but here ya go .
ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .


i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (


how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs ?
...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?
so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .
aka manipulator in chief .
so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .
that seems like quite a comedown . with all due respect to this fine institution .
it 's about ethics in reddit

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .
"deadly rampage ? was "" terrorist attack "" a little too on-the-nose ?"
"why does this headline say "" deadly rampage "" and not "" christian terrorism "" ?"
now i 'm not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted ! i 'll just shoot all the moms and their doctors . absolute lunatic .
thank god its back open. now we can get back to crushing fetus ' heads and sucking their brains out like normal people .
on president 's day ? ! the gaul !
pp is where there is regular deadly rampages..... against unborn babies... .
planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing .

how enforceable is this really ? what do we do when we find tons of food that turns out to be from an illicit source ? destroy it ?
i had no idea this was even a thing
good luck is n't that the entire shrimp industry ?
why was n't this a law like 80 years ago ? ?
i live in a small fishing town and sometimes the price they get for their fish is equivalent to slave labor .
all goods from slave labor ?
can we ban retail items created by slave labor too ? looking at you nike .
it 's not a thing you ca n't import anything produced by slave labor ?

why did n't they care this much about their freaking * home * ? remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting. it was live on cnn ffs !
i do believe they are n't understanding that the phone ca n't be decrypted by apple or anyone .
this is what the fbi was looking for : the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone 's phone. at any time .
why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there ? learn2nsa fbi


* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !
pene means weiner in spanish. that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood .
maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year .
just buy the block/wedge and grate your own .

this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor. if and/or when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight .
i guess they could n't find a picture that makes him look crazier .
news update : spontaneous fires erupt in rome .
that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money .
probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .
looks as though he 's beginning a political career as a goldman / fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him. asshole .
godless commie socialism yes please
""" flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca n't fail "" did anyone else see this ! ? wtf ? so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further ?"
trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .
kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying... .

this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .

this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .


this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .

i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .

...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .

can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .

i 'm all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible. but i also do n't want something rushed either. figure it out. figure it out right .
okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .
who the fuck are they to demand this ? are white/asian/latino people not allowed to be affected by this ?

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .
another article with some details . http : //dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/
this is why i support gun ownership .
inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .
pieces of shit who 've done nothing but take from society
i hope that the assailants rot in prison .
i 'm sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case .
lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?
.... across the street from the fbi headquarters .
""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."
yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?
do black lives matter or do all lives matter ?
black lives matter ? to who ?

fake it til you make it !

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

well shit. i just read a til like last week about him still being alive .
his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek .

he 'll probably need something to help him sleep tonight .
&gt ; the judge who refused to dismiss the case this month has denied cosby 's appeal of that decision . so is that like asking your parents if they are really really sure that you are grounded ?
kanye tweeted cosby is innocent

this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor. if and/or when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight .
i guess they could n't find a picture that makes him look crazier .
news update : spontaneous fires erupt in rome .
that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money .
probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .
looks as though he 's beginning a political career as a goldman / fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him. asshole .
godless commie socialism yes please
""" flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca n't fail "" did anyone else see this ! ? wtf ? so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further ?"
trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .
kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying... .

so an illegal escort vehicle gets pulled over and the entire funeral pulls over to raise hell .
good. the roads are for the living. have your moments at the funeral please .

this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .

can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .

&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .

i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?

her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .

someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?

this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .

unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle

at least the guy was honest .
i would n't be mad if it was my wallet !
how do they know the guy was homeless ?

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

i always love when brand new technologies claim forever .
wish someone would actually do this
they 'll be used as tiddly winks by some kids who dig them up billions of years from now .
quartz ? why do we have to code it onto quartz ? i 'm pretty sure i saw them somewhere record an mp3 file onto water .
when can i buy a burner ? i have to move onto my next project : archiving the world 's vast array of porn !

it says tourism is still banned. there are 12 categories of authorized travel but what are those categories ? cargo ? family ?
idk...looks like cuba has a future in manufacturing to me...just a hunch.. .
so there is no sex tourism like before the embargo yet ?
give the castros their money and let them build paper towns while the real population continues to suffer .
cuba is going on the vacation list. i bet there 's a ton of secluded beaches that have n't been trashed yet by countless tourists .

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

well shit. i just read a til like last week about him still being alive .
his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek .

sounds a lot like hi-tech money laundering to me



how screwed up would you have to be ?
i do n't understand how this happens in a state with safe surrender laws .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .
where is the tipping point for police state ?
the stingray is just one of [ many ] ( https : //theintercept.com/surveillance-catalogue/ ) devices used by our governmental police agencies against us .
what is the point of all this secrecy ? this stuff always comes out .

&gt ; 90 percent of government revenues are from oil ; 70 percent of working saudis are employed by the government ; and even the private sector remains heavily dependent on government spending . haha that about sums up the structural problem right there !
maybe they could rent themselves out as maids to rich philippinos ?
disaffected youth gon na be disaffected .

""" what about us brain-dead slobs ? """

there is place for cockroaches. but not too many . it 's like a big pile of garbages enabled a small tribe to explored into a hoards .

its really a shame that this is even nessesary
coulda gave that money to kanye
these responses... wow .
good god. /r/news commentary is really descending to the level of youtube comments . get a grip you sad sods .
may god bless him. he is a true patriot. spend the money for the future generation through the preservation of our national treasures .
how many hellfire missiles would that buy ?
its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring .
how dare that one-percenter not keep that money to themselves. it 's as if they are n't evil like sanders wants you to believe
i think it 's great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about. what i do n't like is that there should n't even be an issue with funding for our monuments .
if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .
can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .
let 's laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on non-essential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way... ( edit ; and get tax breaks from it too... )
we are living in a new gilded age .
how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions ?
it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .
those goddamn rich people are at it again ! dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges !
fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy .
because republicans refuse to pay for it from fed budget ! !

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .
"deadly rampage ? was "" terrorist attack "" a little too on-the-nose ?"
"why does this headline say "" deadly rampage "" and not "" christian terrorism "" ?"
now i 'm not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted ! i 'll just shoot all the moms and their doctors . absolute lunatic .
thank god its back open. now we can get back to crushing fetus ' heads and sucking their brains out like normal people .

i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .
the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?
offitherrrr i am the law
rochesterian here. the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long .

sad that a majority of these are cancer related. hopefully karma will catch up to them .
i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

thats bad news for all the 7-11 in our town that take them
does n't this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food ?
""" 7/11 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets """
what if the healthy foods do n't sell ? are they still forced to stock them ? would n't you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government ?
no they 'll stop or pack up and leave . ahhh....incentives .
because d'ontravious demands fresh cilantro .
i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved ?

i wonder how reddit is going to try to defend * this * pedophile .

hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents... per day .
not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships .

seriously why are we ( the u.s.a ) importing workers on visas to work at 7-11s ?

how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs ?
...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?
so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .
aka manipulator in chief .
so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .
that seems like quite a comedown . with all due respect to this fine institution .

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .
is n't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor 's office ? would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder .

how dare that one-percenter not keep that money to themselves. it 's as if they are n't evil like sanders wants you to believe
i think it 's great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about. what i do n't like is that there should n't even be an issue with funding for our monuments .
if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .
can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .
let 's laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on non-essential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way... ( edit ; and get tax breaks from it too... )

it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .

ah the browndogle wasting tax payers money for years to come .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .

cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."

hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents... per day .
not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships .
here in the u.s. the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily . edit : some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously .
seriously why are we ( the u.s.a ) importing workers on visas to work at 7-11s ?

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0
so are these bison the ones from the original wild flock that were decimated to almost zero ? i heard there is two breeds the original and a commercial domesticated one ?

this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .

so long commandant lassard ! you brought me many laughs

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .


this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !

are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?

pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .

can someone eli5 me why we even need fracked oil right now when prices are projected to keep dropping ?

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .
a tsgt i know died recently from cancer. he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family. he was 32. his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer .

seriously why are we ( the u.s.a ) importing workers on visas to work at 7-11s ?

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .

this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .

its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .

not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs ?
...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?
so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .
aka manipulator in chief .
so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .
that seems like quite a comedown . with all due respect to this fine institution .
it 's about ethics in reddit

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0

i do n't know how these people live with themselves .
i wonder how long it will be until they open another one .
sad that a majority of these are cancer related. hopefully karma will catch up to them .
i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

i 'm gon na take a stab in the dark and say its just the immense social pressure in the area to be successful but thats just me
the obvious solution to me is the banning or at least rerouting of all caltrains from this particular area .
what does disease control have to do with suicides ? why is this the cdc 's business ?
but if guns are involved they 'll be sued by the nra

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?
but. . .but. . .how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca n't talk about dem big faces ?

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?

yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country .
that vm box is gon na get overloaded quick
pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long run
and sanders wants to make this available for everyone. it 's not the money that causes this agency to be this way it 's the nature of the federal government .
can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional ? in short ? i do n't get it. it seems like they have tons of money but ca n't get their shit together .

how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs ?
...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?

i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .

is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope
driving drunk is not easy .

that 's cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work release

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .


i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .
another article with some details . http : //dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/
this is why i support gun ownership .
inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .
pieces of shit who 've done nothing but take from society
i hope that the assailants rot in prison .
i 'm sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case .
lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?
.... across the street from the fbi headquarters .
""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."
yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?
do black lives matter or do all lives matter ?
black lives matter ? to who ?

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .
who would let their son play american football ?

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .

his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek .

i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .
the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?
offitherrrr i am the law

hope he rots there for the rest of his miserable life !
i just hope they can one by one get every one of those asshole cowboy action-figure wannabes that showed up with their guns to display their extreme patriotism through their act of sedition .
he 's only 69 years old ? i had him pegged for going on 80 !

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .

not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .

i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .

that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .

someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .

ah the browndogle wasting tax payers money for years to come .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .

how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .

it still taste oh so goooooooood !

its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .

i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about !

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .
where is the tipping point for police state ?
the stingray is just one of [ many ] ( https : //theintercept.com/surveillance-catalogue/ ) devices used by our governmental police agencies against us .
what is the point of all this secrecy ? this stuff always comes out .

that 's like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going. it does n't matter .

i 'm all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible. but i also do n't want something rushed either. figure it out. figure it out right .
okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .
who the fuck are they to demand this ? are white/asian/latino people not allowed to be affected by this ?

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .

not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle
i thought this was talking about jesse cox .
"yells loudly "" i will not ! "" . whispers "" if you need me too. """

the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .

loss of internet and television access for 3 days would cause mass panic and riots
my bad people. i went over my 300gb and used way too much of an infinite resource .
&gt ; across us i bet i could find thousands who are angry at comcast * in my town alone * .
i like how this is news in this country .
comcast angers me even without outages .
"the words "" anger "" and "" comcast "" come up often ."
is anyone else still completely fucking down ? just everything ? been down for 15 hours here .
i 've had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i 've never had an issue .
that 's what happens. things go out sometimes .
it 's nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks .
""" compact angers thousands across the u.s. for something other than just being comcast for once "" ftfy"
they just put a data cap on my home internet. how fucked is that ? pretty fucked if you ask me .
"once they fix the outage you 're left with "" comcast anger thousands across us """
now only 1000 years to lrrr ruler of the planet omicron persei 8 comes to destroy earth .

wow now that 's comcastic !
it was out for like 3 hours. jesus christ .

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .


and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .
who would let their son play american football ?

"the student : "" i did n't want my life to end up as part of a shitty movie like 'concussion ' """
plot twist : he ca n't shoot .
there are so many cool sports out there that have gone down in popularity that are cool out there...wrestling for example .
i hope he wears a big ass helmet all the time in order to avoid irony. them baseballs travel fast !

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .
"deadly rampage ? was "" terrorist attack "" a little too on-the-nose ?"
"why does this headline say "" deadly rampage "" and not "" christian terrorism "" ?"
now i 'm not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted ! i 'll just shoot all the moms and their doctors . absolute lunatic .
thank god its back open. now we can get back to crushing fetus ' heads and sucking their brains out like normal people .
on president 's day ? ! the gaul !
pp is where there is regular deadly rampages..... against unborn babies... .
planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing .

they can still go to the doctor and get the scans on their own

why did n't they care this much about their freaking * home * ? remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting. it was live on cnn ffs !
i do believe they are n't understanding that the phone ca n't be decrypted by apple or anyone .
this is what the fbi was looking for : the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone 's phone. at any time .
why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there ? learn2nsa fbi

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .

is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .
you think that 's a wig ?

i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him .
conflict of interests everywhere .
this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .

can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .

i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .

it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .

it still taste oh so goooooooood !

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .


also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?

i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .
eh. personally i 'm more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation. that 's the real problem .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .


i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .
another article with some details . http : //dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/

inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .

i hope that the assailants rot in prison .
i 'm sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case .
lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?

yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?

black lives matter ? to who ?

so more than two months later and they are still farting around getting information that could be important in preventing future actions ? wtf ?

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .

how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs ?
...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?
so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .

idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope
driving drunk is not easy .

that 's cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work release

while the koches paid the mob in nevada to outlaw anything similar there. or so i hypothesize .

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0
so are these bison the ones from the original wild flock that were decimated to almost zero ? i heard there is two breeds the original and a commercial domesticated one ?

now there is a precedence.... i hope apple can appeal this ? ! ? ! ?
i 'm 100 % fine with this. i ca n't believe they need apple though. unless they want everything done legally .

thats bad news for all the 7-11 in our town that take them
does n't this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food ?

no they 'll stop or pack up and leave . ahhh....incentives .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .

as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle
i thought this was talking about jesse cox .

well that 's one bit of good news from cox. now if they 'd stop raising my rates every few months.. .
fuck yea cox ! ( comcast ) ^ -1 = cox
they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jones
almost every single person in my area that has gone to at&amp ; t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable . they have some shit with them but it 's far less shit than others .
the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .
cause they love internet freedom ? or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for .70 an hour ?
protected pirate plan from cox - $ 7500/month .


this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .


well shit. i just read a til like last week about him still being alive .
his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek .

so long commandant lassard ! you brought me many laughs

hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents... per day .
not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships .
here in the u.s. the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily . edit : some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously .
seriously why are we ( the u.s.a ) importing workers on visas to work at 7-11s ?

i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .
aka manipulator in chief .
so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .

how screwed up would you have to be ?
i do n't understand how this happens in a state with safe surrender laws .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .

meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0
so are these bison the ones from the original wild flock that were decimated to almost zero ? i heard there is two breeds the original and a commercial domesticated one ?

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

""" bundy asked for a court-appointed attorney at his first hearing last week "" still living off govt. handouts i see.. ."
""" daughter-in-law briana bundy said tuesday that a federal judge in oregon should let the 69-year-old live at home while he awaits trial. "" sure. that 's an excellent suggestion. i would further suggest that the judge prepare a lunch of peanut butter sandwiches with home made raspberry jam and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies for mr. bundy each day ."
they are just misunderstood. they did this for free sex toys .
not sure he was the worst member of ya 'll-quaida : http : //m.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/15/former-sheriff-willing-let-wife-daughter-die-front/
"hope he gets the "" negros "" there to hear his theory or their culture and living style ."
good ! this arrest and trial has been delayed for too long .
where is the groundswell of the righteously indignant right wing militia that was supposed to come to his aid ?
mmmmmm i need some of the bundy range fed beef. i hope the feds seize it all soon and put it up for sale .
so anyone knows how long a trial like this could last ?
y'alqueda finally facing justice !
well then. that 's that .
does this mean that harry reid 's son 's land deal can finally go through ?

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?
but. . .but. . .how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca n't talk about dem big faces ?

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .



why did n't they care this much about their freaking * home * ? remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting. it was live on cnn ffs !
i do believe they are n't understanding that the phone ca n't be decrypted by apple or anyone .
this is what the fbi was looking for : the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone 's phone. at any time .
why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there ? learn2nsa fbi

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .
another article with some details . http : //dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/

inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .
pieces of shit who 've done nothing but take from society

lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .

i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .
is n't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor 's office ? would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .
where is the tipping point for police state ?
the stingray is just one of [ many ] ( https : //theintercept.com/surveillance-catalogue/ ) devices used by our governmental police agencies against us .
what is the point of all this secrecy ? this stuff always comes out .

this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor. if and/or when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight .
i guess they could n't find a picture that makes him look crazier .
news update : spontaneous fires erupt in rome .
that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money .
probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .
looks as though he 's beginning a political career as a goldman / fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him. asshole .
godless commie socialism yes please
""" flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca n't fail "" did anyone else see this ! ? wtf ? so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further ?"
trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .
kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying... .

hope he rots there for the rest of his miserable life !

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .

how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .

clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .

"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .

just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .

i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .
eh. personally i 'm more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation. that 's the real problem .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !

they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .

meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .


i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .

this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .

what a shocking surprise !

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?

godless commie socialism yes please
""" flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca n't fail "" did anyone else see this ! ? wtf ? so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further ?"
trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .

so these students that are expelled. do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do n't get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless ?
"i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police. presumably so that the assault victims could "" control their own destiny """
&gt ; the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault . there 's your problem right there. how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such .
damned if you do damned if you dont .
seems like the girl was so hammered that she could n't remember the sex. figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault .


now there is a precedence.... i hope apple can appeal this ? ! ? ! ?
i 'm 100 % fine with this. i ca n't believe they need apple though. unless they want everything done legally .

hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents... per day .
not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships .
here in the u.s. the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily . edit : some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously .
seriously why are we ( the u.s.a ) importing workers on visas to work at 7-11s ?

that 's like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going. it does n't matter .
fix flint 's water pipes or they 'll burn flint to the ground !
i 'm all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible. but i also do n't want something rushed either. figure it out. figure it out right .
okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .
who the fuck are they to demand this ? are white/asian/latino people not allowed to be affected by this ?

because america loves her servicemen and women so she wants them to help themselves

yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country .
that vm box is gon na get overloaded quick
pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long run
and sanders wants to make this available for everyone. it 's not the money that causes this agency to be this way it 's the nature of the federal government .
can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional ? in short ? i do n't get it. it seems like they have tons of money but ca n't get their shit together .
tell me more about how universal healthcare will be awesome for the rest of us .
socialized healthcare no thanks .
government-run anything is a disaster .

it 's almost as if germany sees the benefit of having a well educated work force that is not bogged down by insurmountable debt .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .

"hopefully the "" awareness-raising "" fraud that is the susan g. komen foundation for the cure ™ will soon follow ."
"not good enough. you do n't let con artists off the hook if they "" agree "" to shut down the scam. these people committed fraud and belong in jail ."
i do n't know how these people live with themselves .
i wonder how long it will be until they open another one .
sad that a majority of these are cancer related. hopefully karma will catch up to them .
i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?
but. . .but. . .how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca n't talk about dem big faces ?

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .
is n't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor 's office ? would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder .

corruption of public officials in michigan ? no way .
how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner 's hair ? ! ?
lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years. fuck off .
is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .
you think that 's a wig ?
someone call charlie leduff !
i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news .
where is my surprise face ?
a city official operating at a congressional level .
&gt ; detroit contractor who negotiated $ 285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so ? i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged .
i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him .
conflict of interests everywhere .
this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .
public money ? omg
what a shocking surprise !
well that 's convenient

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .

&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0

they need stricter gun control .

hopefully australia has a similar thing to the usa where prisoners are paid like 47 cents... per day .
not as bad as actual slaves that work in unpaid internships .
here in the u.s. the government would go after ahmed and not see an issue with what was going on monetarily . edit : some of you really need to step away from the computer and not take this place so seriously .
seriously why are we ( the u.s.a ) importing workers on visas to work at 7-11s ?

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .
a tsgt i know died recently from cancer. he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family. he was 32. his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer .
""" support our troops with a ribbon sticker ! "" that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through ."
government does n't give a fuck about veterans .
do n't worry guys. we 'll take care of your medical needs when you come home. oh wait.... .
the us govt so cares about its troops.... .
i 've known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazard/disaster since chernobyl .
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals... .
thank god i saved my hazardous exposure memos from balad and taji... if ne1 needs message privately
where is this going to lead to... ?
the horrors of our war in iraq seem to never end
"i read that as "" us military burns pit bulls "" ."
do n't know if anyone who got sick is interested in [ this ] ( http : //www.gelmans.com/readingroom/tabid/65/ctl/articleview/mid/372/articleid/526/burn-pits-claims.aspx ) but here ya go .
ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .

i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh

free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .

idk...looks like cuba has a future in manufacturing to me...just a hunch.. .

...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?
so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .

so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .
that seems like quite a comedown . with all due respect to this fine institution .
it 's about ethics in reddit

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .

meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer

that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !
pene means weiner in spanish. that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .

who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .
kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying... .

paid to act and still goes for the hoverhand .
as young as nine. nine years old. damn .
i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real. they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals .
i just wanted to point out the hand hover
i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .
eh. personally i 'm more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation. that 's the real problem .

okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .
who the fuck are they to demand this ? are white/asian/latino people not allowed to be affected by this ?

why is this front page


now there is a precedence.... i hope apple can appeal this ? ! ? ! ?
i 'm 100 % fine with this. i ca n't believe they need apple though. unless they want everything done legally .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .

anyone else surprised at the extremely low interest rates for mexican bonds ? i would of thought that their borrowing costs was more in line with other developing countries .

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .
another article with some details . http : //dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/

inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .
pieces of shit who 've done nothing but take from society
i hope that the assailants rot in prison .
i 'm sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case .
lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?
.... across the street from the fbi headquarters .
""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."
yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?

why did n't they care this much about their freaking * home * ? remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting. it was live on cnn ffs !
i do believe they are n't understanding that the phone ca n't be decrypted by apple or anyone .
this is what the fbi was looking for : the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone 's phone. at any time .
why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there ? learn2nsa fbi

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

no keep turning the earths crust into swiss cheese for profit i 'm sure everything will be fine .
can someone eli5 me why we even need fracked oil right now when prices are projected to keep dropping ?

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?
but. . .but. . .how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca n't talk about dem big faces ?

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .
"deadly rampage ? was "" terrorist attack "" a little too on-the-nose ?"
"why does this headline say "" deadly rampage "" and not "" christian terrorism "" ?"
now i 'm not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted ! i 'll just shoot all the moms and their doctors . absolute lunatic .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

cash is king in the world of corruption .

it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?

this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .

clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .

"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?

"more from the professional "" victim class "" i guess you need something to do in between police shootings and sanders rallies ."

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

"" sure. that 's an excellent suggestion. i would further suggest that the judge prepare a lunch of peanut butter sandwiches with home made raspberry jam and fresh baked chocolate chip cookies for mr. bundy each day ."

good ! this arrest and trial has been delayed for too long .
where is the groundswell of the righteously indignant right wing militia that was supposed to come to his aid ?
mmmmmm i need some of the bundy range fed beef. i hope the feds seize it all soon and put it up for sale .

well then. that 's that .

i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .
is n't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor 's office ? would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder .

if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pain

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0
so are these bison the ones from the original wild flock that were decimated to almost zero ? i heard there is two breeds the original and a commercial domesticated one ?

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .

i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .

not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

how screwed up would you have to be ?
i do n't understand how this happens in a state with safe surrender laws .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?

godless commie socialism yes please
""" flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca n't fail "" did anyone else see this ! ? wtf ? so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further ?"
trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .
kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying... .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .

the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?
offitherrrr i am the law

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .

what a shocking surprise !
well that 's convenient
can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign ?


fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .

if she only waited five more years in some states they would sentence that 12 year old to child support payments .
holy shit the comment section here.. .
wooooooooo south dakota made the front page ! fuck ! for awful reasons again !
not one comment about how she should be killed or have a train run on her in prison... double standards so glaring it 's like staring at the sun
women dont go to jail as much as men for the same crime. it 's disgusting

let 's see what she looks like

"andddddd i doubt she "" ll get hardly any time or punishment"
why is this front page


what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .

hell of a lot better plan than bombing the facilities in iran. good guy government ?
so they are calling it a success ?
if only they used that cyber attack on shitbag israel instead. la-hymen !

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .
where is the tipping point for police state ?
the stingray is just one of [ many ] ( https : //theintercept.com/surveillance-catalogue/ ) devices used by our governmental police agencies against us .
what is the point of all this secrecy ? this stuff always comes out .

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .
a tsgt i know died recently from cancer. he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family. he was 32. his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer .
""" support our troops with a ribbon sticker ! "" that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through ."
government does n't give a fuck about veterans .
do n't worry guys. we 'll take care of your medical needs when you come home. oh wait.... .
the us govt so cares about its troops.... .
i 've known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazard/disaster since chernobyl .
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals... .
thank god i saved my hazardous exposure memos from balad and taji... if ne1 needs message privately
where is this going to lead to... ?
the horrors of our war in iraq seem to never end
"i read that as "" us military burns pit bulls "" ."
do n't know if anyone who got sick is interested in [ this ] ( http : //www.gelmans.com/readingroom/tabid/65/ctl/articleview/mid/372/articleid/526/burn-pits-claims.aspx ) but here ya go .
ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle
i thought this was talking about jesse cox .
"yells loudly "" i will not ! "" . whispers "" if you need me too. """
i knew he was my favorite eagle
well that 's one bit of good news from cox. now if they 'd stop raising my rates every few months.. .
fuck yea cox ! ( comcast ) ^ -1 = cox
they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jones
almost every single person in my area that has gone to at&amp ; t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable . they have some shit with them but it 's far less shit than others .
the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .
cause they love internet freedom ? or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for .70 an hour ?
protected pirate plan from cox - $ 7500/month .

idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope
driving drunk is not easy .
what is 10 day weekend work release ?
that 's cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work release
and my mom wonders why i 'm not married .


why did n't they care this much about their freaking * home * ? remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting. it was live on cnn ffs !
i do believe they are n't understanding that the phone ca n't be decrypted by apple or anyone .
this is what the fbi was looking for : the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone 's phone. at any time .
why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there ? learn2nsa fbi

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !

just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s

the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .

this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle
i thought this was talking about jesse cox .
"yells loudly "" i will not ! "" . whispers "" if you need me too. """
i knew he was my favorite eagle
well that 's one bit of good news from cox. now if they 'd stop raising my rates every few months.. .
fuck yea cox ! ( comcast ) ^ -1 = cox
they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jones
almost every single person in my area that has gone to at&amp ; t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable . they have some shit with them but it 's far less shit than others .
the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .
cause they love internet freedom ? or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for .70 an hour ?

he 's only 69 years old ? i had him pegged for going on 80 !

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (

"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !

it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .


no keep turning the earths crust into swiss cheese for profit i 'm sure everything will be fine .
can someone eli5 me why we even need fracked oil right now when prices are projected to keep dropping ?

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .


sounds a lot like hi-tech money laundering to me

anyone else surprised at the extremely low interest rates for mexican bonds ? i would of thought that their borrowing costs was more in line with other developing countries .

no need to make 'em human shaped ! i want a hoof

its really a shame that this is even nessesary
coulda gave that money to kanye
these responses... wow .
good god. /r/news commentary is really descending to the level of youtube comments . get a grip you sad sods .
may god bless him. he is a true patriot. spend the money for the future generation through the preservation of our national treasures .
how many hellfire missiles would that buy ?
its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring .
how dare that one-percenter not keep that money to themselves. it 's as if they are n't evil like sanders wants you to believe
i think it 's great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about. what i do n't like is that there should n't even be an issue with funding for our monuments .
if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .
can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .
let 's laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on non-essential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way... ( edit ; and get tax breaks from it too... )
we are living in a new gilded age .
how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions ?
it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .
those goddamn rich people are at it again ! dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges !
fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy .
because republicans refuse to pay for it from fed budget ! !
$ 18 million. [ that could have stopped about 6000 kids from dying of malaria ] ( http : //www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf # costperlifesaved ) . one man 's philanthropist is another man 's guy who does n't see the big picture .


good on his father for turning in his son for this crime. that cant be an easy thing to do. but he did the right thing .
that fucker is 19 ? looks 39
i hope the cop gets better .
dont ever let this shithead have an ounce of freedom
how does a bullet fragment if it enters through the eye ?
19 years old and your life 's over for the contents of a cash register. just.....why ?
wish people would stop shooting cops. it 's making them all scared and trigger happy .

this thread https : //www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/460zpf/without_insulting_anyone_what_would_you_say_to/d01ln36
it 's about damn time we made sure innocent good people had guns and training and could defend themselves ! ! or.. we could stop giving guns to everybody. gee i do n't know. .
maybe the cop was making furtive movements .


they need stricter gun control .


a special place in hell ... will probably begin in prison for this low-life .
if he is on film a trial should not be necessary. his public execution though. .
who wants to bet on whether he makes it through a trial ?
the death penalty needs to be expanded .

why did n't they care this much about their freaking * home * ? remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting. it was live on cnn ffs !
i do believe they are n't understanding that the phone ca n't be decrypted by apple or anyone .
this is what the fbi was looking for : the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone 's phone. at any time .
why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there ? learn2nsa fbi

who 's the idiot who decided that kangaroo courts were a good idea ?
eli5 kangaroo courts. thanks !

jane roe because jane doe would be incest .
so these students that are expelled. do they have to still pay back their loans even though they do n't get a degree now and can they carry their credits over to another school or are they now worthless ?
"i love how at the end she implies that if there were a person punching people randomly on campus they would choose to not involve the police. presumably so that the assault victims could "" control their own destiny """
&gt ; the university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault . there 's your problem right there. how about be tough on those convicted of sexual assault and those whom the law decides are innocent be treated as such .
damned if you do damned if you dont .
seems like the girl was so hammered that she could n't remember the sex. figured it would be less shameful if she accused him of assault .

yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country .
that vm box is gon na get overloaded quick
pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long run
and sanders wants to make this available for everyone. it 's not the money that causes this agency to be this way it 's the nature of the federal government .
can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional ? in short ? i do n't get it. it seems like they have tons of money but ca n't get their shit together .
tell me more about how universal healthcare will be awesome for the rest of us .

""" bundy asked for a court-appointed attorney at his first hearing last week "" still living off govt. handouts i see.. ."

not one comment about how she should be killed or have a train run on her in prison... double standards so glaring it 's like staring at the sun
women dont go to jail as much as men for the same crime. it 's disgusting
judge is going to come down on her hard with 6 months probation i guarantee .

let 's see what she looks like
i hope he siouxs her ass off !
"andddddd i doubt she "" ll get hardly any time or punishment"
why is this front page


what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .


this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .
you know how law and order is the cornerstone of society and only exists if enforced ? well fuck it no more police and no more rules ! ! ! fucking stupid juveniles .
umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .


why cant everyone choose this option equally ? badges dont grant extra rights
law ruled unconstitutional in 3... 2.. .
public servants my ass ?
just fuck the east coast .
it 's an undesirable response to an undesirable reality that cop-killing is getting it 's own category as a hate crime .

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .
another article with some details . http : //dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/
this is why i support gun ownership .
inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .
pieces of shit who 've done nothing but take from society
i hope that the assailants rot in prison .
i 'm sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case .
lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?
.... across the street from the fbi headquarters .
""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."
yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?
do black lives matter or do all lives matter ?
black lives matter ? to who ?

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !
pene means weiner in spanish. that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood .
maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year .
just buy the block/wedge and grate your own .

well shit. i just read a til like last week about him still being alive .
his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .



i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .
is n't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor 's office ? would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder .
ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance .
if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pain
because that makes it okay... * smh *

i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .
the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?
offitherrrr i am the law
rochesterian here. the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long .
i drove through rochester today ! has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate ?
new york has pretty harsh dui laws if my memory serves me correctly
[ it 's fucking vodka maaaaaaaaaan ! ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = r5h6ie_hd_g )
that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women .
if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful positions
well who 's gon na judge the case now ?
her judgement was impaired
fry needs to weigh in here : http : //imgur.com/gvji0um
ny state troopers only care about the star program. more tix/arrest = promotion/money. so if they could get points on there own mother they would .
i 'm just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit xd
i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore .
oh they decided the law applies today ?
"* spits out drink * "" it 's fucking vodka man ! """

this is a political talking point floated to make sanders look like an over reactor. if and/or when he loses the nomination this guy and his idea will disappear from sight .
i guess they could n't find a picture that makes him look crazier .
news update : spontaneous fires erupt in rome .
that should have been one of the stipulations for their bailout money .
probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .
looks as though he 's beginning a political career as a goldman / fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him. asshole .
godless commie socialism yes please
""" flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca n't fail "" did anyone else see this ! ? wtf ? so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further ?"
trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .
kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying... .

they can still go to the doctor and get the scans on their own

hope he rots there for the rest of his miserable life !

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .


so more than two months later and they are still farting around getting information that could be important in preventing future actions ? wtf ?

""" impaled "" sounds about as much of an overstatement as "" got a splinter "" would be an understatement in this case ."

i 'm all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible. but i also do n't want something rushed either. figure it out. figure it out right .
okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .
who the fuck are they to demand this ? are white/asian/latino people not allowed to be affected by this ?

it says tourism is still banned. there are 12 categories of authorized travel but what are those categories ? cargo ? family ?
idk...looks like cuba has a future in manufacturing to me...just a hunch.. .

give the castros their money and let them build paper towns while the real population continues to suffer .
cuba is going on the vacation list. i bet there 's a ton of secluded beaches that have n't been trashed yet by countless tourists .

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .
"deadly rampage ? was "" terrorist attack "" a little too on-the-nose ?"
"why does this headline say "" deadly rampage "" and not "" christian terrorism "" ?"

i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?

this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .

not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .

"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .

just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s

""" bundy asked for a court-appointed attorney at his first hearing last week "" still living off govt. handouts i see.. ."

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !

are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .

meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .

bitcoin is the answer

someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .

this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .

"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .

black lives matter ? to who ?


this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .
a tsgt i know died recently from cancer. he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family. he was 32. his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer .

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

well shit. i just read a til like last week about him still being alive .
his fatal mistake was using that old refrigerator to play hide and seek .

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .

i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .


this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .
i hope that people realize that doxing is not something that should be cheered .
anything worth even looking at in this release ?
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .

if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .

it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (

no need to make 'em human shaped ! i want a hoof

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?

okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .
who the fuck are they to demand this ? are white/asian/latino people not allowed to be affected by this ?

probably not that big of a problem anymore. they 've plundered just about all they can at this point and pushing much farther would risk a pecorah commission 2.0 which might show just how corrupt and rigged its become .
looks as though he 's beginning a political career as a goldman / fed plant telling the people what they want to hear so that they can maintain power through the inevitable coming reforms when our shit falls apart because of his bosses and him. asshole .
godless commie socialism yes please
""" flooding them with so much cash they virtually ca n't fail "" did anyone else see this ! ? wtf ? so basically print a shitload more money and reward their bad behavior further ?"
trust me they are not doing this to be altruistic. they know its coming down the pipe they are just being proactive so that they can do it to benefit themselves as much as possible rather than letting the government do it .
kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying... .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0
so are these bison the ones from the original wild flock that were decimated to almost zero ? i heard there is two breeds the original and a commercial domesticated one ?

it says tourism is still banned. there are 12 categories of authorized travel but what are those categories ? cargo ? family ?
idk...looks like cuba has a future in manufacturing to me...just a hunch.. .
so there is no sex tourism like before the embargo yet ?
give the castros their money and let them build paper towns while the real population continues to suffer .
cuba is going on the vacation list. i bet there 's a ton of secluded beaches that have n't been trashed yet by countless tourists .

anyone else surprised at the extremely low interest rates for mexican bonds ? i would of thought that their borrowing costs was more in line with other developing countries .

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .
a tsgt i know died recently from cancer. he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family. he was 32. his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer .
""" support our troops with a ribbon sticker ! "" that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through ."
government does n't give a fuck about veterans .
do n't worry guys. we 'll take care of your medical needs when you come home. oh wait.... .
the us govt so cares about its troops.... .
i 've known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazard/disaster since chernobyl .
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals... .
thank god i saved my hazardous exposure memos from balad and taji... if ne1 needs message privately
where is this going to lead to... ?
the horrors of our war in iraq seem to never end
"i read that as "" us military burns pit bulls "" ."
do n't know if anyone who got sick is interested in [ this ] ( http : //www.gelmans.com/readingroom/tabid/65/ctl/articleview/mid/372/articleid/526/burn-pits-claims.aspx ) but here ya go .
ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

the majority of colorado is not going to be happy about this .
reasonable safety concerns. the awareness that comes from these discussions trumps the the annual event .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .

you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .

let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .


i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .
the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?
offitherrrr i am the law
rochesterian here. the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long .
i drove through rochester today ! has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate ?
new york has pretty harsh dui laws if my memory serves me correctly
[ it 's fucking vodka maaaaaaaaaan ! ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = r5h6ie_hd_g )
that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women .
if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful positions
well who 's gon na judge the case now ?
her judgement was impaired
fry needs to weigh in here : http : //imgur.com/gvji0um
ny state troopers only care about the star program. more tix/arrest = promotion/money. so if they could get points on there own mother they would .
i 'm just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit xd
i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore .
oh they decided the law applies today ?

can someone eli5 me why we even need fracked oil right now when prices are projected to keep dropping ?

they can still go to the doctor and get the scans on their own

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !
pene means weiner in spanish. that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood .

okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .
who the fuck are they to demand this ? are white/asian/latino people not allowed to be affected by this ?

while the koches paid the mob in nevada to outlaw anything similar there. or so i hypothesize .

why did n't they care this much about their freaking * home * ? remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting. it was live on cnn ffs !

kind of sounds like what bernie sanders has been saying... .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .

can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .

this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11

the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .


this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .

i 've known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazard/disaster since chernobyl .
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals... .

so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle

this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .


i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .

cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .

anything worth even looking at in this release ?
if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear .
you would think they would be fighting for stronger encryption to hide their doings .

is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?
but. . .but. . .how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca n't talk about dem big faces ?

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .
a tsgt i know died recently from cancer. he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family. he was 32. his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer .
""" support our troops with a ribbon sticker ! "" that will definitely make up for all the fucked up shit the government puts them through ."
government does n't give a fuck about veterans .
do n't worry guys. we 'll take care of your medical needs when you come home. oh wait.... .
the us govt so cares about its troops.... .
i 've known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazard/disaster since chernobyl .
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals... .
thank god i saved my hazardous exposure memos from balad and taji... if ne1 needs message privately
where is this going to lead to... ?
the horrors of our war in iraq seem to never end
"i read that as "" us military burns pit bulls "" ."
do n't know if anyone who got sick is interested in [ this ] ( http : //www.gelmans.com/readingroom/tabid/65/ctl/articleview/mid/372/articleid/526/burn-pits-claims.aspx ) but here ya go .
ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

the county commissioner who spearheaded the public sales tax for the bengals and reds stadia now works for the bengals .
let the $ 14 dollar beer flow .
corruption of public officials in michigan ? no way .
how in the fuck are there no comments about the red wings owner 's hair ? ! ?
lol illitch has done more for the city of detroit than any other person in the last 50 years. fuck off .
is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .
you think that 's a wig ?
someone call charlie leduff !
i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news .
where is my surprise face ?
a city official operating at a congressional level .
&gt ; detroit contractor who negotiated $ 285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so ? i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged .
i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him .
conflict of interests everywhere .
this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .
public money ? omg
what a shocking surprise !
well that 's convenient
can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign ?


cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .


i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .
the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?
offitherrrr i am the law
rochesterian here. the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long .
new york has pretty harsh dui laws if my memory serves me correctly
[ it 's fucking vodka maaaaaaaaaan ! ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = r5h6ie_hd_g )
that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women .
if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful positions
well who 's gon na judge the case now ?
her judgement was impaired
fry needs to weigh in here : http : //imgur.com/gvji0um
ny state troopers only care about the star program. more tix/arrest = promotion/money. so if they could get points on there own mother they would .
i 'm just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit xd
i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore .
oh they decided the law applies today ?
"* spits out drink * "" it 's fucking vodka man ! """


its really a shame that this is even nessesary
coulda gave that money to kanye
these responses... wow .
good god. /r/news commentary is really descending to the level of youtube comments . get a grip you sad sods .
may god bless him. he is a true patriot. spend the money for the future generation through the preservation of our national treasures .
how many hellfire missiles would that buy ?
its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring .
how dare that one-percenter not keep that money to themselves. it 's as if they are n't evil like sanders wants you to believe
i think it 's great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about. what i do n't like is that there should n't even be an issue with funding for our monuments .
if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .
can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .
let 's laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on non-essential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way... ( edit ; and get tax breaks from it too... )
we are living in a new gilded age .
how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions ?
it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .
those goddamn rich people are at it again ! dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges !
fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy .
because republicans refuse to pay for it from fed budget ! !
$ 18 million. [ that could have stopped about 6000 kids from dying of malaria ] ( http : //www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf # costperlifesaved ) . one man 's philanthropist is another man 's guy who does n't see the big picture .


this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .


what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .


jesus the auto repairman ?

now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever .

i do believe they are n't understanding that the phone ca n't be decrypted by apple or anyone .

so there is no sex tourism like before the embargo yet ?
give the castros their money and let them build paper towns while the real population continues to suffer .
cuba is going on the vacation list. i bet there 's a ton of secluded beaches that have n't been trashed yet by countless tourists .

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle
i thought this was talking about jesse cox .
"yells loudly "" i will not ! "" . whispers "" if you need me too. """
i knew he was my favorite eagle
well that 's one bit of good news from cox. now if they 'd stop raising my rates every few months.. .
fuck yea cox ! ( comcast ) ^ -1 = cox
they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jones
almost every single person in my area that has gone to at&amp ; t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable . they have some shit with them but it 's far less shit than others .
the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0

i do n't understand how this happens in a state with safe surrender laws .

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

i know it is a reach. but why do these people need to make high salaries. it is a charity you are supposed to be doing something good for other people. if pay is needed. then just like congress no more than 80k. you are performing a service for people . 10 of those charities involve the police. the nickel tin mafia have their hands in all kinds of money making rackets .

so long commandant lassard ! you brought me many laughs

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day

yes lets expand this grand system of healthcare to everyone in the country .
that vm box is gon na get overloaded quick
pissing off trained military personnel seems like a dumb idea in the long run
and sanders wants to make this available for everyone. it 's not the money that causes this agency to be this way it 's the nature of the federal government .
can anyone explain why the va is so dysfunctional ? in short ? i do n't get it. it seems like they have tons of money but ca n't get their shit together .
tell me more about how universal healthcare will be awesome for the rest of us .
socialized healthcare no thanks .

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .




and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .

i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference

i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .


this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?
civil forfeiture time !
time to start using gold .
are these the same banks that as basically laundering all the cartels drug money ?
they should accept bitcoin. problem solved .
and you just made it worse by telling people this
meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .
so print an article about it so everyone knows they have lots of cash .
bitcoin is the answer
time to start their own offshore banking system with bitcoins .
that ’ s because it ’ s cash day at the collection center – when marijuana dispensary owners are allowed to bring in paper cash to pay their quarterly sales tax bill – and the scent in their stock clings to the whole lot .
pot shops are always the only places i see armed guards in southern california .
its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .
can they not employ armored trucks ?
it 's the same way in washington and colorado. it 's still illegal as far as the fed is concerned and the banks are governed by the fed .
watch out for that ~ ~ cop robbery ~ ~ civil asset forfeiture .
build your own secure fort. no law against hiring armed employees to guard a building .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .


he 'll probably need something to help him sleep tonight .

how screwed up would you have to be ?
i do n't understand how this happens in a state with safe surrender laws .


they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .
where is the tipping point for police state ?
the stingray is just one of [ many ] ( https : //theintercept.com/surveillance-catalogue/ ) devices used by our governmental police agencies against us .
what is the point of all this secrecy ? this stuff always comes out .

where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .

it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .

i 've had comcast xfinity for almost 2 years now and i 've never had an issue .
that 's what happens. things go out sometimes .
it 's nothing new that comcast absolutely sucks .

it 's not like we 're losing * that * much more bandwidth. it 's only like 20 megs less than what we had before. which was only 80 megs less than what we 're paying for .
just having comcast in general makes them angry .

china should just rename the street in front of the u.s. embassy 'snowden ave'. problem solved .
here on the west coast we 're already getting serious fallout from china 's fucking pollution .
serious fallout : like the nuclear fallout that would be spread over the entirety of the east and the pacific ocean if anyone in china decides it 's time to do anything concrete against the u.s . we 'll destroy the fucking world while laughing about it and accusing you of fault .
what are we...china 's lil bitch ? i dont think another country should have implications on our freedom of speech. if anything this makes me want this place to be renamed .

its really a shame that this is even nessesary
coulda gave that money to kanye
these responses... wow .
good god. /r/news commentary is really descending to the level of youtube comments . get a grip you sad sods .
may god bless him. he is a true patriot. spend the money for the future generation through the preservation of our national treasures .
how many hellfire missiles would that buy ?
its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring .
how dare that one-percenter not keep that money to themselves. it 's as if they are n't evil like sanders wants you to believe
i think it 's great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about. what i do n't like is that there should n't even be an issue with funding for our monuments .
if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .
can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .
let 's laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on non-essential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way... ( edit ; and get tax breaks from it too... )
we are living in a new gilded age .
how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions ?
it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .
those goddamn rich people are at it again ! dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges !
fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .

can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11

not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

while the koches paid the mob in nevada to outlaw anything similar there. or so i hypothesize .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .

my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?


thats bad news for all the 7-11 in our town that take them
does n't this just translate into fewer places for poor people to buy food ?
""" 7/11 cashiers will now have to ring up cigarettes as organic kale instead of hot pockets """
what if the healthy foods do n't sell ? are they still forced to stock them ? would n't you think the actual grocers in the neighborhood would have a better sense of what their customers want than the federal government ?
no they 'll stop or pack up and leave . ahhh....incentives .
because d'ontravious demands fresh cilantro .
i wonder how much crime in a store would go down if the store was no longer food stamp approved ?

hell of a lot better plan than bombing the facilities in iran. good guy government ?
so they are calling it a success ?
if only they used that cyber attack on shitbag israel instead. la-hymen !

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .

is there anything that analyzes the effect of comerica park being built in downtown detroit ? or ford field ? most people would not step foot downtown if it was n't for those two places. i know the article saying that stadiums being financed through tax payer money do n't bring forth revitalization like intended...but the only article i 've read was about stadiums in la and sf .
you think that 's a wig ?
someone call charlie leduff !
i wonder if journalists really think this is breaking news .
where is my surprise face ?
a city official operating at a congressional level .
&gt ; detroit contractor who negotiated $ 285 million in public money for the red wings now works with red wings owner so ? i love how these headlines are supposed to make us feel outraged .
i guess he did such a good job raising money that he hired him .
conflict of interests everywhere .
this is how it works....there is n't anything new to this story that is n't happening in nearly every major city and state across the country . i do n't like it but as soon as we accept it we can change it .
public money ? omg
what a shocking surprise !
well that 's convenient
can we just start an embarrass the fuck out of these greedy punks campaign ?



paid to act and still goes for the hoverhand .
as young as nine. nine years old. damn .
i doubt half the people even read the article and thought the video was real. they were actors and were stopped by plenty of people who called them criminals .
i just wanted to point out the hand hover
i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .
eh. personally i 'm more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation. that 's the real problem .

the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .

and it begins ; the exodus away from our national infatuation with football .
i played football for 4 years in highschool. started all 4 years. i will never allow my kids to play unless they really really want to. id rather have them play a sport with less contact or have them do theater because thats just as fun
this is really just a click bait story. no big school gave him a scholarship so he would be stuck playing d2 football. almost no d2 players ever make it into the nfl. he is now getting offers to play basketball at schools and is looking at those offers . i would like to see him turn down full rides to alabama or ohio state before we talk about how great this kids choice is .
who would let their son play american football ?

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?

in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?
larry summers is another idiot having access to a microphone .
how would this effect the bitcoin market ?
but. . .but. . .how will weezy and drizzy write raps now if they ca n't talk about dem big faces ?


now they just need to find a way to reverse liver cirrhosis and i can live forever .
this is a breakthrough right up until the pharmaceutical companies buy the process and tuck it away forever ; there 's no money to be made in curing a disease .

* every * pre-packaged shredded cheese has it. it 's the most common anti-clumping agent used around the world. the argument is that the labels said 100 % cheese .
so my penne has wood ?
so the correct labeling is 92 % cheese and 8 % wood filler ? i think that 's right .
i 'm safe . source : only sprinkle parmesan on spaghetti .
i shred my own parmesan cheese . it makes worlds difference
this is why i do n't buy nasty sargento cheese. ever taste it ? it tastes like wood . i buy the store stuff that clumps together because it tastes much better .
hmm. i am pretty sure i misread that title .
it 's cheaper by the chunk anyways .
my parents always called it cardboard cheese
it still taste oh so goooooooood !
pene means weiner in spanish. that mean we could be potentionally sprinkling wood on our wood .
maybe they are just trying to get people to eat a whole door over the course of a year .
just buy the block/wedge and grate your own .

i wonder if it has anything to do with increasing the cost of an abortion further limiting them .
is n't this just to force abortions to be in an operating room type environment instead of standard doctor 's office ? would raise the threshold significantly and make abortion access much harder .
ignorant people propose bill based on said ignorance .
if you pinch a fetus it will cry so that pretty much proves they feel pain
because that makes it okay... * smh *

good on his father for turning in his son for this crime. that cant be an easy thing to do. but he did the right thing .

it 's about damn time we made sure innocent good people had guns and training and could defend themselves ! ! or.. we could stop giving guns to everybody. gee i do n't know. .
maybe the cop was making furtive movements .


how enforceable is this really ? what do we do when we find tons of food that turns out to be from an illicit source ? destroy it ?

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

it says tourism is still banned. there are 12 categories of authorized travel but what are those categories ? cargo ? family ?

give the castros their money and let them build paper towns while the real population continues to suffer .

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11
why is this news ?
the revolution will not be subsidized
the whole student loan thing is a complete disaster
just stop going to fucking college unless someone pays you to. the paper really is n't worth it otherwise. college is becoming a joke anyways .


i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .


so to sum that up we do n't have to worry about any cox blocking .
this must be a new thing. many a year 's ago before we were smart enough to password protect our wlan. we got a letter in the mail telling us that someone was downloading entourage and we did n't even know what that was ! none of us knew what that even was. and then we figured out the neighbors were using our wifi .
basically bmg is a an evil company throwing a tantrum .
&gt ; last december a virginia federal jury ruled that internet provider cox communications was responsible for the copyright infringements of its subscribers . what the actual fucking fuck ?
as a customer this is the first good thing i 've ever heard from cox .
not true from my experience .
unrelated but i could n't stop laughing in the leasing office when the woman was telling me they were prewired for cox .
i am a proud supporter of cox .
where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .
when will the entertainment industries except the fact that they will never really win this battle
i thought this was talking about jesse cox .
"yells loudly "" i will not ! "" . whispers "" if you need me too. """
i knew he was my favorite eagle
well that 's one bit of good news from cox. now if they 'd stop raising my rates every few months.. .
fuck yea cox ! ( comcast ) ^ -1 = cox
they are like the east india trading company when they teamed up with davy jones
almost every single person in my area that has gone to at&amp ; t uverse or other provider has come back to cox cable . they have some shit with them but it 's far less shit than others .
the shifting of blame to continue.. . going after johns and endusers has never worked.. .
cause they love internet freedom ? or because it costs an extra 30 cents to have an extra indian screen data at the call center for .70 an hour ?
protected pirate plan from cox - $ 7500/month .




so more than two months later and they are still farting around getting information that could be important in preventing future actions ? wtf ?

ny state troopers only care about the star program. more tix/arrest = promotion/money. so if they could get points on there own mother they would .

this will be an interesting story as it plays out for all parties. the docs and comments on the forum board are searing. i would imagine many it/information systems security specialists are busy in a number of departments .
i assume that these show that the police were wonderful upstanding individuals with no dark secrets whatsoever ?
cant virtually any police officer look up information on virtually any person they wish without warrant or justification ? one might think they only care about their own privacy with this outcry .

umm the pbco definitely is low on the totten pole of corrupt cops. there 's hardly any crime in that county or rogue cops .

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

i was happier before i knew this subculture existed .
so the camera man got 50 years while the person torturing the animals got 10... that does n't make much sense .
how can things be so wrong in persons life they begin to feel sexual pleasure from watching small animals being abused and killed...how from the moment of your birth to that time in your life you develop this deeply concerning fetish are things going so wrong. 10 years is not long enough it was probably only a matter of time until they moved onto a human .
no complaints from me but i 've noticed a trend of people getting way harder sentences than even just a decade ago .
i 'm not saying this is n't some of the sickest shit out there but this is a longer sentence than someone would get for rape or even murder... .
who the fuck beats off to animals being killed ? what the fuck
i just dont understand what the fuck is wrong with people. naked on film stabbing puppies and kittens... wtf...i just dont understand
i took a class on sex crimes investigation when i was a detective. it was the first exposure i 'd ever had to this subculture ( crush fetish ) . after watching about five hours of these videos i amassed a serious hatred for these individuals . their actions are cruel and unconscionable and they deserve imprisonment or worse. that 's all i have to say about that .
well... that just ruined my day
i would have been perfectly happy never knowing such videos existed. : (
fuck. people are fucked .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?

heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .

where are all the penis jokes ?
not as nice as it sounds. if they accept that responsibility they can be liable for ones they do n't catch and it can jeopardize their common carrier status ( e.g that they do n't have any liability/responsibility for what people use their pipe for ) . most carriers are * very * vested in not being the internet police .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .

this system is going to be the cause of someone dying because they are held up on cash day .
this is why they get robbed all the time out here. no point in robbing a bank when you can rob these guys .
ca n't these businesses start their own bank or do you not do credit unions in the us ?

meanwhile.. . [ larry summers : it 's time to kill the $ 100 bill ] ( http : //www.businessinsider.com/summers-time-to-kill-the-100-bill-2016-2 ) the banking system is corrupt anyhow. its time to flush this turd system for something better .
sell gift cards ? buy them with debit/credit. then use the gift card .

its a shame they cant count on the highway-robber police to guard the money .
it looks like they 're tripping over themselves to make it easy to cook the books .
this will finally prove just how dangerous marijuana really is .
someone is eventually going to figure out how to provide merchant services to these dispensaries and that person is going to become very wealthy .
what is there to prevent these businesses from selling gift cards to their store and allowing credit / checks for those transactions ? then just but the trees with the gift certificate .
as if the banks do n't take drug money as we speak. it is also not like the fbi do n't have cases on going against those banks. i really do n't see why there is a problem .

free expression runs counter to the new religion of progressivism. the two simply are not compatible .


also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s

they do not care what police do with them . they hand them out like candy and do not tell people about overwhelming surveillance used against them . edward snowden said that the end result is so that the government has the capability to look back in time over every post and thing you put in public or in private to create whatever politically charged narrative will be convenient for whatever opponent to the police state they want to create . that is our future with our technology for the most part completely unsafe and untrustworthy to guard you at all . they do not care about you. you are a peon to them unless your in the inner circle .

the stingray is just one of [ many ] ( https : //theintercept.com/surveillance-catalogue/ ) devices used by our governmental police agencies against us .

bison burgers. bison steaks. bison roasts . yum .
the opening statement is actually pretty interesting as some believe the population of bison grew to such staggering numbers as a result of unchecked growth following the massive loss of human live among native americans after the introduction of western diseases. one theory is that the native americans provided population control for the bison .
it 's population control . hopefully they use the meat to feed the homeless or another practical use .
can....can i help ?
npr text article and radio discussion if anyone is interested : http : //mtpr.org/post/officials-agree-cull-many-900-yellowstone-bison # stream/0
so are these bison the ones from the original wild flock that were decimated to almost zero ? i heard there is two breeds the original and a commercial domesticated one ?

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .

cash is king in the world of corruption .
the difference ? money .
it 's almost like the rich live under different rules .
my mom has always said guilty until proven rich .
i worked hard and slaved away all my life so that my children could be above the law. this is the american dream .
...and liberty and justice for all ( who can afford it ) .
the real crime here.... those eyebrows
that 's why the case became famous. because he got away while guilty. that was autocorrect capitalization .
let 's be clear. what happened to the poor kid was what 's supposed to happen when you drive drunk and kill someone. you fucking go to prison. couch was the exception .
that kid and both his parents need to be in jail for a very long time .
( * sees title * ) probably not a rich white kid ( * clicks article * ) and yuuuuuuuuuup smh
prime example of how the us legal system is pay to win .
obviously as white god intended .
the difference ? money .
did anyone else think the thumbnail was some kid pushing his face against a window ?
by similar case i assume you mean hundreds of cases all the time ?
excuse me for not sympathizing based on what he did .
lemmeguess... ethnic ? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand they 're ethnic .
cash rules everything around me. they have $ and very good lawyers .
free public defender vs 2000 $ an hour lawyer .
"that 's what "" affluenza "" means. literally the entire point of this case and why it 's been in the news is that the judge held him less culpable because he was rich ."
he should be kept in prison if only just for those eyebrows. wtf .
there 's actually a legal question that you asked .
you do n't automatically get a dui in fact .

i kinda laugh when some of the refugees bring their 12 year old wife to the country. it 's picked up on pretty instantly and they get charged with rape or molestation of a minor the second they manage to dig forth something sexual. some of them just do n't realize that shit like that is treated almost as if it where on par with murder. and it should because it is one of the most evil things you can do .
eh. personally i 'm more concerned with men sitting with their legs spread on public transportation. that 's the real problem .

idiot drinks and drives and shares it with people over some app. idiot gets arrested for drinking and driving. it is the idiots first time offense and the idiot gets sentenced to standard punishment for a first time offense. nothing to see here .
is that typical for a first time offense in florida ?
12 months of probation plus losing your license is pretty standard.. .
heh that click bait title makes it sound like she go off free
her sentence actually sounds kinda harsh for a first time dui .
most people do n't go to jail for first time dui. the rest of her sentence was pretty tough though .
it was n't flordia man... it was flordia woman.. .
premeditated drinking and driving is that a thing because she admitted to it
this is great pr for periscope

what is 10 day weekend work release ?
that 's cool they gave her 0 days in jail but allowed her 10 days of weekend work release

also cars. bad guys use those a lot. and the internet. also food .
casinos would lobby against it. a million dollars in hundreds is surprisingly small. it would fit in a plastic shopping bag. a million dollars in small bills is massive . there are lots of legal businesses that handle large volumes of cash .
how about we scrap larry summers and make life easier for the 99 % ?
thats why they got rid of the $ 500 bill....and it didnt work so well .
i was going to buy drugs today but the thought of bringing four $ 50.00 bills instead of two $ 100.00 was too taxing. better go straight .
clearly $ 100 bills are the problem. .
people still listen to larry summers ? i kinda figured all his credibility went out he window back in 2008. or does cnn still think repealing glass-steagall was a good idea ?
"it 's not about stopping criminals it 's about controlling peoples money. with cash you can buy what you want where you want whenever you want without the government knowing. they want to make it so that all your money is tracked electronically. this is what done in europe to prevent "" tax fraud "" ."
in europe they are going to scrap the 500 euro bill so americans also want to follow suit and scrap the highest denomination of their currency. the difference being that the 500 euro note was not widely accepted while everyone accepts the $ 100 bill. it is very popular outside the us .
the new blue $ 100 bills are too cool to replace .
how on earth are the police going to make space for all the lower denomination bills they are going to be seizing instead of those crisp hundreds ? ! ? !
attention : we must fight any efforts to get rid of cash ( except pennies ) . cash is privacy and should be a basic right .
is something going on with all the major currencies ? i saw a similar story about the euro notes too . http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3448066/ecb-considers-scrapping-500-euro-note.html also http : //www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3437590/banks-urged-ban-50-notes-bid-end-cash-hand-culture-help-recoup-billions-tax-treasury.html all these stories within a week of each other . i would n't be surprised if they are trying to push us all towards an all digital currency .
currently in colorado : hundreds of legal pot shops paying taxes with cash .
bring back the $ 500 and $ 1000 dollar bills dammit !
just legalize crime. everybody wins .
fuk this illuminati puppet
banksters do n't even use cash. oh wait. you 're talking about the little criminals. carry on .
then after all the large denominations are destroyed everyone with cash is obviously a criminal. there is nothing that could go wrong with this way of thinking that only criminals use the largest bill denomination. /s
than how will our government and cia function ?
interning theory. main problem is for people who have been redlined by banks paying serveval hundred to a few thousand bucks for rent or large one offs like a car should be some very unwieldy stacks .
"is n't the $ 100 bill the staple of american foreign trade ? i even read an article stating that the us government even made a profit when foreigners used them like "" interest-free "" loans ( though it also stated that a lot of those using them overseas were using them for criminal purposes ) ."
politicians do n't use $ 100s so how could it harm criminals ?
what the fuck am i gon na snort the coke through then ?

what happens if you literally ca n't pay your loans ? asking because i know somebody who took out 60k at 11 % just for the first year and flunked and has to pay over 500 per month in interest alone on a minimum wage job . edit : something a lot of you do n't seem to realize is that these were private loans. there 's no forgiveness with those .
how do you not pay a $ 1500 loan after 30 friggin years... .
&gt ; he says seven deputy us marshals showed up at his home with guns and took him to federal court where he had to sign a payment plan for the 29-year-old school loan . this almost reads like satire .
i suppose debtors could start living off the grid and hiding out in ponds going full on amphibious to escape debt collectors .
can i get a misleading title please .
you would think someone with education would understand that borrowing money means having to pay it back some day .
i knew this story was light on facts. turns out he refused to go in to court after being contacted several times by deputies. it only took 7 deputies to arrest him because he claimed he had a gun and retreated into his home when initially approached by two deputies . source : [ yahoo finance ] ( https : //finance.yahoo.com/news/paul-aker-us-marshal-student-loan-debt-arrest-212047386.html )
&gt ; our reliable source with the us marshal in houston say aker is n't the first and wo n't be the last . this immediately makes me think their source is not reliable in the least .
this just in : there are legal repercussions for not paying money owed to the federal government. film at 11

how enforceable is this really ? what do we do when we find tons of food that turns out to be from an illicit source ? destroy it ?
i had no idea this was even a thing
good luck is n't that the entire shrimp industry ?
why was n't this a law like 80 years ago ? ?
i live in a small fishing town and sometimes the price they get for their fish is equivalent to slave labor .
all goods from slave labor ?
can we ban retail items created by slave labor too ? looking at you nike .
it 's not a thing you ca n't import anything produced by slave labor ?

why cant everyone choose this option equally ? badges dont grant extra rights
law ruled unconstitutional in 3... 2.. .
public servants my ass ?
just fuck the east coast .
it 's an undesirable response to an undesirable reality that cop-killing is getting it 's own category as a hate crime .

from what i 've read he was getting violent with the hospital staff and the cops. it looks like the taser use was justified. sometimes it makes sense to use force if the situation ca n't be deescalated otherwise . has there been anything released concerning the reason that he died ?
this is unacceptable. tazers are lethal and we need to stop pretending they are n't .
he died 5 days later at a different hospital . clickbait headline. i 'm sure we 'll find that the stun gun was not the cause of death .
"well at least the officers saved the victim from harming "" himself "" ."
he died a week later. he was also resisting arrest .
officers ca n't subdue people without shocking them to death...stun guns should be used on clearly dangerous people only. not some wack trying to get mental help .
police are to trigger happy. they could easily have uses their......oh .
"police are not there "" to protect and serve "" you . edit : [ warren v. district of columbia ] ( https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia ) is just one example that downvoters should read ."

i have my own super secret private social network site that only i know about !
anyone else get the feeling this was an ad ?
i bet tom from facebook is already a member
facebook 's shills are working overtime in this posts comments. i hope this social media site becomes a viable alternative .
private. social media. pick one .
i love when people treat shit like this like news. downvote it to where it belongs .
i would trust this site over facebook .

hell of a lot better plan than bombing the facilities in iran. good guy government ?
so they are calling it a success ?
if only they used that cyber attack on shitbag israel instead. la-hymen !

i 'm gon na take a stab in the dark and say its just the immense social pressure in the area to be successful but thats just me
the obvious solution to me is the banning or at least rerouting of all caltrains from this particular area .
what does disease control have to do with suicides ? why is this the cdc 's business ?
but if guns are involved they 'll be sued by the nra

so an illegal escort vehicle gets pulled over and the entire funeral pulls over to raise hell .
good. the roads are for the living. have your moments at the funeral please .
got ta love reddits horrible bias with facts when it comes to the police .

fucking sad how this was n't described as an act of terrorism. i guess that title is reserved for non-christians .
it is sad that it closed even for a short time. people like fiorina do n't give a crap about the shooter or people on the fringe like him. all they care about is they were able to stop the clinic for even a small amount of time.. .
how the hell did he forget about the shooter or people on the fringe like him .
"deadly rampage ? was "" terrorist attack "" a little too on-the-nose ?"
"why does this headline say "" deadly rampage "" and not "" christian terrorism "" ?"
now i 'm not a fan of abortions but who the hell can think to themselves i know how to stop babies from being aborted ! i 'll just shoot all the moms and their doctors . absolute lunatic .
thank god its back open. now we can get back to crushing fetus ' heads and sucking their brains out like normal people .
on president 's day ? ! the gaul !
pp is where there is regular deadly rampages..... against unborn babies... .
planned parenthood is basically condoms and the oklahoma city bombing .

that 's like threatening to get one of those online white house petitions going. it does n't matter .
fix flint 's water pipes or they 'll burn flint to the ground !
i 'm all for getting this fixed as quickly as possible. but i also do n't want something rushed either. figure it out. figure it out right .
okay...and then what ? all of the protesting has n't done jack so far. what 's one more protest going to do ? it 's not going to make the state government move any faster ; it 's very clear that the government - at every level - is more concerned about covering itself. a protest is n't going to change that .
who the fuck are they to demand this ? are white/asian/latino people not allowed to be affected by this ?

so anyone knows how long a trial like this could last ?

well then. that 's that .
does this mean that harry reid 's son 's land deal can finally go through ?

why did n't they care this much about their freaking * home * ? remember all those reporters and camera crews contaminating all that evidence after the shooting. it was live on cnn ffs !
i do believe they are n't understanding that the phone ca n't be decrypted by apple or anyone .
this is what the fbi was looking for : the one terrorist case it can trumpet to prove it needs to unlock anyone 's phone. at any time .
why not just dump the phones firmware and then brute force it there ? learn2nsa fbi

at least the guy was honest .

how do i get one of these fuck around on the internet jobs ?
...because twitter has been such a phenomenal business success
&gt ; the former news manager at twitter and the person behind today in black twitter do n't we have that subreddit already ? ?
so more sponsored posts. too bad voat.co is such a shitty alternative .
i see more reddit buttons coming up on news websites .
so is his job to come around and censor our posts ?
just as a precaution.. . i think we all should be putting on our life jackets .
aka manipulator in chief .
so we will have the whole anita sarkeesian safe space like twitter is becoming. and this was the great marketing that is killing them .
that seems like quite a comedown . with all due respect to this fine institution .
it 's about ethics in reddit

this hits close to home. we had a burn pit in baghdad during my time there. i developed bronchitis as well as something else that made me so sick i dropped a lot of weight. i really need to get this checked out .
a tsgt i know died recently from cancer. he had deployed to afghanistan and the cancer he had did not run in his family. he was 32. his widow whole heartedly believes that the burn pits were the cause of his cancer .

i 've known military to have permanent letters added to their medical records saying they have been exposed to the worst man made hazard/disaster since chernobyl .
little did we know that the iraqis and the taliban did n't have to bother to actually lob chemical/bio weapons at us. we 'd send our troops over in mass numbers to be ordered by officers to chem/bio bomb themselves . did i mention today how much i hate bush and cheney ?
every goddamn war the military has to do something that exposes troops to dangerous chemicals... .

ca n't be -- bush lied ! right ? right ? ?
my brother in law and everyone in his squad all got lung cancer during the last iraq war. he is the last one still alive from it and is doing well .
that was one messy cakewalk .
they should turn on the masters and their supporters .
so not just all that depleted uranium we unloaded on them... ?
i thought iraq did n't have wmd 's ?
such a simple solution : rotate out the troops doing this much faster and constantly train replacements
am i the only one who read that at first as burn pit bulls ?

i 've never heard of court on a saturday. thats pretty crazy .
the balls of steel on that trooper to be arresting a judge though !
it should be interesting to see how she 's ruled in cases of dui in the past .
she refused a breathalyzer meh she 'll beat this
would n't being drunk compromise her ability to judge ? how many times has she been impaired while working ? should n't anyone who has been a part of her proceedings get a retrial in the least ? what should i make for dinner ?
offitherrrr i am the law
rochesterian here. the article failed to mention that she was also driving with 2 flat tires for who knows how long .
i drove through rochester today ! has anyone ever heard of a garbage plate ?
new york has pretty harsh dui laws if my memory serves me correctly
[ it 's fucking vodka maaaaaaaaaan ! ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v = r5h6ie_hd_g )
that would suck to have your case decided by a slurring women .
if i know new york this should be a nasty slap on this wrist especially for those in powerful positions
well who 's gon na judge the case now ?
her judgement was impaired
fry needs to weigh in here : http : //imgur.com/gvji0um
ny state troopers only care about the star program. more tix/arrest = promotion/money. so if they could get points on there own mother they would .
i 'm just amazed that our local news channel in lafayette is on the front page of reddit xd
i feel like poor judgement like this should make you not a judge anymore .
oh they decided the law applies today ?
"* spits out drink * "" it 's fucking vodka man ! """


good on his father for turning in his son for this crime. that cant be an easy thing to do. but he did the right thing .
that fucker is 19 ? looks 39
i hope the cop gets better .
dont ever let this shithead have an ounce of freedom
how does a bullet fragment if it enters through the eye ?
19 years old and your life 's over for the contents of a cash register. just.....why ?
wish people would stop shooting cops. it 's making them all scared and trigger happy .
kinda looks like trayvon martin and mike brown had a kid .
i do n't understand... reddit says that loggers and farmers have more dangerous jobs .

this thread https : //www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/460zpf/without_insulting_anyone_what_would_you_say_to/d01ln36
it 's about damn time we made sure innocent good people had guns and training and could defend themselves ! ! or.. we could stop giving guns to everybody. gee i do n't know. .
maybe the cop was making furtive movements .


its really a shame that this is even nessesary
coulda gave that money to kanye
these responses... wow .
good god. /r/news commentary is really descending to the level of youtube comments . get a grip you sad sods .
may god bless him. he is a true patriot. spend the money for the future generation through the preservation of our national treasures .
how many hellfire missiles would that buy ?
its amazing what one can do with volunteer philanthropy vs compulsory caring .
how dare that one-percenter not keep that money to themselves. it 's as if they are n't evil like sanders wants you to believe
i think it 's great that this person stood up and donated to something they care about. what i do n't like is that there should n't even be an issue with funding for our monuments .
if we 're committed to the federal government to spend his money to make them even better i 'm all for it .
can you tell him to donate it to the department of commerce building too ?
it 'd be better spent on refurbishing the dc metro .
that 's nice for a full on rapist to do .
let 's laugh at people in need by blowing tens of millions on non-essential shit that basically benefits nobody in any significant way... ( edit ; and get tax breaks from it too... )
we are living in a new gilded age .
how about some love for our crumbling infastructure instead of some tourist atractions ?
it 's gon na suck for him when 20 years from now people decide these monuments are celebrating a racist heritage and deface them/fight to take them down .
those goddamn rich people are at it again ! dammit if we could only find a way to tax away their wealth so we could spend it on poorly negotiated deals for mediocre roads and bridges !
fixing stupid shit is hardly philanthropy .
because republicans refuse to pay for it from fed budget ! !

i wonder if they changed his opinion on that topic .
i live in dc. groups of teenagers do this kind of stuff every day. never makes the news. public defenders keep getting them off the charges claiming they are just kids and do n't know what they are doing. worst part it 's never anyone who will fight back. not that you ever win in a situation when the 11 assailants are between the ages of 13-15. but they have seriously injured folks in the past. brain damage and internal bleeding. i typically avoid groups of young black men now. i feel a little bad about it. like i 'm being racist. but i have to much to loose and i would not keep my cool if confronted .
another article with some details . http : //dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/marine-allegedly-assaulted-mid-burger-at-mcdonalds-as-gang-yelled-do-you-believe-black-lives-matter/
this is why i support gun ownership .
inb4 this thread gets nuked by the mods .
pieces of shit who 've done nothing but take from society
i hope that the assailants rot in prison .
i 'm sure the justice department will be putting in the same effort to investigate this as a hate crime as they have with other crimes like the zimmerman case .
lock these shitheads up and throw away the key
do white lives matter to blacks ?
i really want to know how this blm saga will unfold . it 's really political. blm proponents are both self proclaimed victims ( and apparently supported by a whole bunch of sjws ) and perpetrators of heinous crimes in the name of blm . how much power do the sjws really have ? will this be another kent state or will this be another communist revolution ?
.... across the street from the fbi headquarters .
""" do black lives matter... if you do n't agree we 'll beat and rob you "" ... and people wonder why there is hostility to the way they go about this movement ."
yeah. beating a man and robbing him is a surefire way to get your point across right ?
